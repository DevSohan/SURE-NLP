‘Urban -Rural Assembly (URA)’ follows the hypothesis that strategic integrated, participative, place- 
based and environmentally sensitive urban- rural development represents a key lever to build resilient 
and s ustainable urban futures. URA focuses on the case study region of Huangyan- Taizhou, Zhejiang 
province, located at the margin of China’s highly dynamic eastern urbanisation corridor as a 
prototypical urban- rural learning context, where diverse and seemingly contradictory transformation 
processes take place redefining urban- hinterland relations. Huangyan- Taizhou demonstrates both - the 
interrelated social, economic and environmental risks and policy gaps that emerge, as well as multiple 
local innovations and experiments with potentials to inform new pathways toward sustainability. URA 
builds up a mutually beneficial learning partnership linking an interdisciplinary Sino- German research 
team of urban planners, landscape architects, environmental engineers, soci ologists and economists 
to: (1) Address critical knowledge gaps related to the complex transformation processes that 
shape the urban-rural interface by studying how current urbanisation dynamics and land use 
changes impact on intricate water- settlement -patterns, cultural heritage, ecosystem services, food and 
energy flows and generate new socio- spatial coping practices; (2) Develop strategic participatory 
transformation scenarios for three exemplary Urban -Rura l Living Labs (URLL) which will serve as 
transdisciplinary testing grounds for strengthening ecological -oriented urban- rural integration; (3) 
Develop strategic tools and guiding principles for integrated urban- rural planning and governance 
that can be adopted by other regions and address the necessity of transfer and ‘scaling’; (4) Develop a 
networking and dissemination strategy to contribute to a global debate on how to strengthen urban- 
rural interrelations and linkages to achieve more effective transitio ning- to-sustainability. 
 
2. Problem Statement, Current Research & Development Gaps 
Constituting only 18 % in 1978, China’s urban population has rapidly grown up to over 60% by the end 
of 2019 (NBSC 2020), mainly due to rural -to-urban migration. Judging by an average annual growth 
rate (2011 -2018) of urbanization at 1.19 %, one can foresee further expansion of urban population 
(ibid.). This unique state- led urbanization program was accompanied by a transition toward market - 
oriented economies based on growth models (Ren 2013), which has profoundly affected lifestyles, work 
patterns, incomes, family structures and personal aspirations of the Chinese society (NBSC 2019). 
While, initially, research and policies focussed primarily on rapidly growing (mega)cities and urbanisation corridors, more recently, the formerly rural hinterlands have come into focus, including 
demographic shrinking and ageing as a result of rural -to-urban migration, the difficulties to quality 
public service provision, the threat to cultural heritage and identity preservation, losses of farmland, and 
widespread poverty or environmental challenges. Indeed, uneven development (linked to socio- spatial 
polarisation and divergence in development) across China has increasingly been recognised as a 
major obstacle on the way toward a more socially, economi cally and environmentally sustainable and 
equitable transformation model. Here, Chinese policies have included the new -type urbanization 
agenda (2014 -2020) (State Council 3/16/2014) promoting new real -estate development aiming to 
attract rural peasants to give up and leave their villages (Ren 2013; Webber 2012; Yeh et al. 2013).
 
More recent initiatives, including e.g. the rural revitalization agenda (2018- 2022) (State Council 
9/26/2018) supporting the development of a ‘beautiful and harmonious countryside’ already begin to 
address the importance of stabilizing formerly rural regions. Mainly driven by an increasing domestic 
tourism sector targeting the rising Chinese middle class (Lu and Fan, 2010), enormous investments ‘Urban -Rural Assembly (URA)’ follows the hypothesis that strategic integrated, participative, place-

agenda (2014 -2020) (State Council 3/16/2014) promoting new real -estate development aiming to 
attract rural peasants to give up and leave their villages (Ren 2013; Webber 2012; Yeh et al. 2013).
 
More recent initiatives, including e.g. the rural revitalization agenda (2018- 2022) (State Council 
9/26/2018) supporting the development of a ‘beautiful and harmonious countryside’ already begin to 
address the importance of stabilizing formerly rural regions. Mainly driven by an increasing domestic 
tourism sector targeting the rising Chinese middle class (Lu and Fan, 2010), enormous investments ‘Urban -Rural Assembly (URA)’ follows the hypothesis that strategic integrated, participative, place- 
based and environmentally sensitive urban- rural development represents a key lever to build resilient 
and s ustainable urban futures. URA focuses on the case study region of Huangyan- Taizhou, Zhejiang 
province, located at the margin of China’s highly dynamic eastern urbanisation corridor as a 
prototypical urban- rural learning context, where diverse and seemingly contradictory transformation 
processes take place redefining urban- hinterland relations. Huangyan- Taizhou demonstrates both - the 
interrelated social, economic and environmental risks and policy gaps that emerge, as well as multiple 
local innovations and experiments with potentials to inform new pathways toward sustainability. URA 
builds up a mutually beneficial learning partnership linking an interdisciplinary Sino- German research 
team of urban planners, landscape architects, environmental engineers, soci ologists and economists 
to: (1) Address critical knowledge gaps related to the complex transformation processes that 
shape the urban-rural interface by studying how current urbanisation dynamics and land use 
changes impact on intricate water- settlement -patterns, cultural heritage, ecosystem services, food and 
energy flows and generate new socio- spatial coping practices; (2) Develop strategic participatory 
transformation scenarios for three exemplary Urban -Rura l Living Labs (URLL) which will serve as 
transdisciplinary testing grounds for strengthening ecological -oriented urban- rural integration; (3) 
Develop strategic tools and guiding principles for integrated urban- rural planning and governance 
that can be adopted by other regions and address the necessity of transfer and ‘scaling’; (4) Develop a 
networking and dissemination strategy to contribute to a global debate on how to strengthen urban- 
rural interrelations and linkages to achieve more effective transitio ning- to-sustainability. 
 
2. Problem Statement, Current Research & Development Gaps 
Constituting only 18 % in 1978, China’s urban population has rapidly grown up to over 60% by the end 
of 2019 (NBSC 2020), mainly due to rural -to-urban migration. Judging by an average annual growth 
rate (2011 -2018) of urbanization at 1.19 %, one can foresee further expansion of urban population 
(ibid.). This unique state- led urbanization program was accompanied by a transition toward market - 
oriented economies based on growth models (Ren 2013), which has profoundly affected lifestyles, work 
patterns, incomes, family structures and personal aspirations of the Chinese society (NBSC 2019). 
While, initially, research and policies focussed primarily on rapidly growing (mega)cities and urbanisation corridors, more recently, the formerly rural hinterlands have come into focus, including 
demographic shrinking and ageing as a result of rural -to-urban migration, the difficulties to quality 
public service provision, the threat to cultural heritage and identity preservation, losses of farmland, and 
widespread poverty or environmental challenges. Indeed, uneven development (linked to socio- spatial 
polarisation and divergence in development) across China has increasingly been recognised as a 
major obstacle on the way toward a more socially, economi cally and environmentally sustainable and 
equitable transformation model. Here, Chinese policies have included the new -type urbanization

oriented economies based on growth models (Ren 2013), which has profoundly affected lifestyles, work 
patterns, incomes, family structures and personal aspirations of the Chinese society (NBSC 2019). 
While, initially, research and policies focussed primarily on rapidly growing (mega)cities and urbanisation corridors, more recently, the formerly rural hinterlands have come into focus, including 
demographic shrinking and ageing as a result of rural -to-urban migration, the difficulties to quality 
public service provision, the threat to cultural heritage and identity preservation, losses of farmland, and 
widespread poverty or environmental challenges. Indeed, uneven development (linked to socio- spatial 
polarisation and divergence in development) across China has increasingly been recognised as a 
major obstacle on the way toward a more socially, economi cally and environmentally sustainable and 
equitable transformation model. Here, Chinese policies have included the new -type urbanization 
agenda (2014 -2020) (State Council 3/16/2014) promoting new real -estate development aiming to 
attract rural peasants to give up and leave their villages (Ren 2013; Webber 2012; Yeh et al. 2013).
 
More recent initiatives, including e.g. the rural revitalization agenda (2018- 2022) (State Council 
9/26/2018) supporting the development of a ‘beautiful and harmonious countryside’ already begin to 
address the importance of stabilizing formerly rural regions. Mainly driven by an increasing domestic 
tourism sector targeting the rising Chinese middle class (Lu and Fan, 2010), enormous investments ‘Urban -Rural Assembly (URA)’ follows the hypothesis that strategic integrated, participative, place- 
based and environmentally sensitive urban- rural development represents a key lever to build resilient 
and s ustainable urban futures. URA focuses on the case study region of Huangyan- Taizhou, Zhejiang 
province, located at the margin of China’s highly dynamic eastern urbanisation corridor as a 
prototypical urban- rural learning context, where diverse and seemingly contradictory transformation 
processes take place redefining urban- hinterland relations. Huangyan- Taizhou demonstrates both - the 
interrelated social, economic and environmental risks and policy gaps that emerge, as well as multiple 
local innovations and experiments with potentials to inform new pathways toward sustainability. URA 
builds up a mutually beneficial learning partnership linking an interdisciplinary Sino- German research 
team of urban planners, landscape architects, environmental engineers, soci ologists and economists 
to: (1) Address critical knowledge gaps related to the complex transformation processes that 
shape the urban-rural interface by studying how current urbanisation dynamics and land use 
changes impact on intricate water- settlement -patterns, cultural heritage, ecosystem services, food and 
energy flows and generate new socio- spatial coping practices; (2) Develop strategic participatory 
transformation scenarios for three exemplary Urban -Rura l Living Labs (URLL) which will serve as 
transdisciplinary testing grounds for strengthening ecological -oriented urban- rural integration; (3) 
Develop strategic tools and guiding principles for integrated urban- rural planning and governance 
that can be adopted by other regions and address the necessity of transfer and ‘scaling’; (4) Develop a 
networking and dissemination strategy to contribute to a global debate on how to strengthen urban- 
rural interrelations and linkages to achieve more effective transitio ning- to-sustainability. 
 
2. Problem Statement, Current Research & Development Gaps 
Constituting only 18 % in 1978, China’s urban population has rapidly grown up to over 60% by the end 
of 2019 (NBSC 2020), mainly due to rural -to-urban migration. Judging by an average annual growth 
rate (2011 -2018) of urbanization at 1.19 %, one can foresee further expansion of urban population
