overcome sectoral fragmentation at national and local governance levels to ensure more integrated and inclusive 
approaches for transitioning urban spaces to sustainability. This is especia lly applicable to the critical gap at the 
juncture between urban water management and urban planning. The applied research project Polyurbwater 
addresses this gap by exploring the multiple interlinkages between both sectors and by developing concepts 
and t ools for planning and governance approaches for fast growing, secondary and tertiary cities Southeast Asia 
(SEA), a region that remains under -researched (Roberts, 2014 ; Daniere et al., 2020). The results from the 
project's Definition Phase confirmed the pa rticular relevance of the nexus between water management and urban 
planning as well as the limitations of classical approaches towards infrastructure development and planning in 
comprehensively addressing social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities that will be drastically 
exacerbated by climate change. Based on the hypothesis that polycentric approaches to urban water 
management can address mismatches between needs and capacities of these cities, the research project 
Polyurbwater pursues the followi ng questions: 
1. How can a diverse set of stakeholders contribute to building an inter - and transdisciplinary local knowledge 
base on water and urban development related challenges in the SEA region? How can this knowledge be 
systemati zed, scaled and regularly updated to serve as a basis for inclusive and future -oriented municipal 
planning approaches across the region? 
2. How can effective and sustainable water -sensitive urban development be fostered through a combination of 
centralized an d decentralized technical and social -ecological innovations, including Nature -Based Solutions (NBS), 
participatory strategic planning and effective water management structures, as an integral part of a systemic 
polycentric nexus approach (water, waste, ene rgy, housing, IT, food, community development, etc.)? 
3. How can “water” serve as a strategic entry point towards integrated, inclusive and resilient urban development 
that is guided by the SDG framework? Which polycentric, intersectoral and participatory go vernance approaches 
are required to plan, develop, sustainably operate and finance such integrated water -sensitive development that 
has the capacity to evolve further in line with dynamic urbanization processes? 
4. How can local innovation processes inform ne w practice -oriented pedagogies, capacity building approaches 
and research agendas to strengthen a network of academic institutions in the region? 
Polyurbwater is a project of an inter - and transdisciplinary research consortium of academic institutions, civ il 
society organizations, public/government institutions, private sector actors and cities from Cambodia, Germany, 
Indonesia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. Polyurbwater focuses its research activities around three Living Labs 
located in Sleman (Indonesia), S am Neua (Laos) and Kratie (Cambodia), which provide a representative cross -
section of the challenges faced by fast -growing secondary and tertiary cities in SEA in diverse governance 
contexts. The research will develop and test innovative and transferable t ools for inclusive, cross -sectoral 
decision -making for polycentric water -sensitive urban development and support its exemplary implementation. 
The project will develop a research and learning partnership across SEA and with Germany. Close cooperation 
with regional and multilateral organizations such as UNESCAP and German Water Partnership (GWP) will allow

Polyurbwater is a project of an inter - and transdisciplinary research consortium of academic institutions, civ il 
society organizations, public/government institutions, private sector actors and cities from Cambodia, Germany, 
Indonesia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. Polyurbwater focuses its research activities around three Living Labs 
located in Sleman (Indonesia), S am Neua (Laos) and Kratie (Cambodia), which provide a representative cross -
section of the challenges faced by fast -growing secondary and tertiary cities in SEA in diverse governance 
contexts. The research will develop and test innovative and transferable t ools for inclusive, cross -sectoral 
decision -making for polycentric water -sensitive urban development and support its exemplary implementation. 
The project will develop a research and learning partnership across SEA and with Germany. Close cooperation 
with regional and multilateral organizations such as UNESCAP and German Water Partnership (GWP) will allow 
deeper, transferable and scalable knowledge a nd know -how for their effective localization. A key challenge is to 
overcome sectoral fragmentation at national and local governance levels to ensure more integrated and inclusive 
approaches for transitioning urban spaces to sustainability. This is especia lly applicable to the critical gap at the 
juncture between urban water management and urban planning. The applied research project Polyurbwater 
addresses this gap by exploring the multiple interlinkages between both sectors and by developing concepts 
and t ools for planning and governance approaches for fast growing, secondary and tertiary cities Southeast Asia 
(SEA), a region that remains under -researched (Roberts, 2014 ; Daniere et al., 2020). The results from the 
project's Definition Phase confirmed the pa rticular relevance of the nexus between water management and urban 
planning as well as the limitations of classical approaches towards infrastructure development and planning in 
comprehensively addressing social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities that will be drastically 
exacerbated by climate change. Based on the hypothesis that polycentric approaches to urban water 
management can address mismatches between needs and capacities of these cities, the research project 
Polyurbwater pursues the followi ng questions: 
1. How can a diverse set of stakeholders contribute to building an inter - and transdisciplinary local knowledge 
base on water and urban development related challenges in the SEA region? How can this knowledge be 
systemati zed, scaled and regularly updated to serve as a basis for inclusive and future -oriented municipal 
planning approaches across the region? 
2. How can effective and sustainable water -sensitive urban development be fostered through a combination of 
centralized an d decentralized technical and social -ecological innovations, including Nature -Based Solutions (NBS), 
participatory strategic planning and effective water management structures, as an integral part of a systemic 
polycentric nexus approach (water, waste, ene rgy, housing, IT, food, community development, etc.)?

and t ools for planning and governance approaches for fast growing, secondary and tertiary cities Southeast Asia 
(SEA), a region that remains under -researched (Roberts, 2014 ; Daniere et al., 2020). The results from the 
project's Definition Phase confirmed the pa rticular relevance of the nexus between water management and urban 
planning as well as the limitations of classical approaches towards infrastructure development and planning in 
comprehensively addressing social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities that will be drastically 
exacerbated by climate change. Based on the hypothesis that polycentric approaches to urban water 
management can address mismatches between needs and capacities of these cities, the research project 
Polyurbwater pursues the followi ng questions: 
1. How can a diverse set of stakeholders contribute to building an inter - and transdisciplinary local knowledge 
base on water and urban development related challenges in the SEA region? How can this knowledge be 
systemati zed, scaled and regularly updated to serve as a basis for inclusive and future -oriented municipal 
planning approaches across the region? 
2. How can effective and sustainable water -sensitive urban development be fostered through a combination of 
centralized an d decentralized technical and social -ecological innovations, including Nature -Based Solutions (NBS), 
participatory strategic planning and effective water management structures, as an integral part of a systemic 
polycentric nexus approach (water, waste, ene rgy, housing, IT, food, community development, etc.)? 
3. How can “water” serve as a strategic entry point towards integrated, inclusive and resilient urban development 
that is guided by the SDG framework? Which polycentric, intersectoral and participatory go vernance approaches 
are required to plan, develop, sustainably operate and finance such integrated water -sensitive development that 
has the capacity to evolve further in line with dynamic urbanization processes? 
4. How can local innovation processes inform ne w practice -oriented pedagogies, capacity building approaches 
and research agendas to strengthen a network of academic institutions in the region? 
Polyurbwater is a project of an inter - and transdisciplinary research consortium of academic institutions, civ il 
society organizations, public/government institutions, private sector actors and cities from Cambodia, Germany, 
Indonesia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. Polyurbwater focuses its research activities around three Living Labs 
located in Sleman (Indonesia), S am Neua (Laos) and Kratie (Cambodia), which provide a representative cross -
section of the challenges faced by fast -growing secondary and tertiary cities in SEA in diverse governance 
contexts. The research will develop and test innovative and transferable t ools for inclusive, cross -sectoral 
decision -making for polycentric water -sensitive urban development and support its exemplary implementation. 
The project will develop a research and learning partnership across SEA and with Germany. Close cooperation 
with regional and multilateral organizations such as UNESCAP and German Water Partnership (GWP) will allow 
deeper, transferable and scalable knowledge a nd know -how for their effective localization. A key challenge is to 
overcome sectoral fragmentation at national and local governance levels to ensure more integrated and inclusive 
approaches for transitioning urban spaces to sustainability. This is especia lly applicable to the critical gap at the 
juncture between urban water management and urban planning. The applied research project Polyurbwater
