
During the Build4People Definition Phase we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the 
Cambodian context and local characteristics that concern the research field of the 
Build4People project and the specific research questions according to WP#1. The research 
stays, the comprehensive exchange with our local researc h partners and other stakeholders 
in form of conferences and workshops, as well as many internal project discussions, specified 
our research approach. Furthermore, our interviews (as a preparation for our survey) and the first pre -test of the survey gave manifold insights into the contextual factors, the 
environmental conditions as well as perceptions and experiences of citizens of Phnom Penh. So far, we have observed a rather limited local knowledge on the mindset of the urban 
population from an environmen tal psychology perspective. 
An important insight for us according to the environmental awareness of people in Phnom Penh was the difference between local and global environmental issues. Many local environmental problems such as air pollution and the lack of waste management were often 
reported. Local organizations and institutions already show some measures to meet those 
environmental problems, e.g. by aiming at the promotion of the avoidance of plastic, of less usage of plastic bags, of saving of drinking water, enhanced waste management, etc. 
Corresponding posters and materials are observable in public spaces, official institutions or 
restaurants. During the project discussions and exchange with local actors however , the 
awareness and understanding of glo bal environmental problems such as climate change was 
lacking. The connection of one’s own individual behaviour with global environmental 
problems is usually not considered. This impression is in line with findings according to the Gallup World Poll, indic ating that awareness of global climate change is higher in wealthier 
and higher educated countries (Knight, 2016). We reckon that this understanding should be addressed by special intervention techniques focusing on knowledge transfer and the 
reflection of observable social practices a nd their influence on the local and global 
environment. One possible way to approach this topic will be a collaborative workshop together with WP # 5 on urban climate, climate change consequences and climate change adaptation in Cambodia. Environmental con cern and problem awareness can be defined as 
necessary, but not at all as sufficient preconditions of pro -environmental behaviour (see 
Abrahamse et al. 2005). However, an increase of problem awareness and salient social norms are important when developing interventions for behaviour change and campaigns, in order 
to prepare a basis for more sufficient strategies like strengthening social support or increasing 
self-efficacy by concrete information about possible behaviour options (Klöckner, 2013).

in form of conferences and workshops, as well as many internal project discussions, specified 
our research approach. Furthermore, our interviews (as a preparation for our survey) and the first pre -test of the survey gave manifold insights into the contextual factors, the 
environmental conditions as well as perceptions and experiences of citizens of Phnom Penh. So far, we have observed a rather limited local knowledge on the mindset of the urban 
population from an environmen tal psychology perspective. 
An important insight for us according to the environmental awareness of people in Phnom Penh was the difference between local and global environmental issues. Many local environmental problems such as air pollution and the lack of waste management were often 
reported. Local organizations and institutions already show some measures to meet those 
environmental problems, e.g. by aiming at the promotion of the avoidance of plastic, of less usage of plastic bags, of saving of drinking water, enhanced waste management, etc. 
Corresponding posters and materials are observable in public spaces, official institutions or 
restaurants. During the project discussions and exchange with local actors however , the 
awareness and understanding of glo bal environmental problems such as climate change was 
lacking. The connection of one’s own individual behaviour with global environmental 
problems is usually not considered. This impression is in line with findings according to the Gallup World Poll, indic ating that awareness of global climate change is higher in wealthier 
and higher educated countries (Knight, 2016). We reckon that this understanding should be addressed by special intervention techniques focusing on knowledge transfer and the 
reflection of observable social practices a nd their influence on the local and global 
environment. One possible way to approach this topic will be a collaborative workshop together with WP # 5 on urban climate, climate change consequences and climate change adaptation in Cambodia. Environmental con cern and problem awareness can be defined as 
necessary, but not at all as sufficient preconditions of pro -environmental behaviour (see 
Abrahamse et al. 2005). However, an increase of problem awareness and salient social norms are important when developing interventions for behaviour change and campaigns, in order 
to prepare a basis for more sufficient strategies like strengthening social support or increasing 
self-efficacy by concrete information about possible behaviour options (Klöckner, 2013). 
 
During the Build4People Definition Phase we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the 
Cambodian context and local characteristics that concern the research field of the 
Build4People project and the specific research questions according to WP#1. The research
