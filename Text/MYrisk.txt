1.1 Multiple risks – challenges for the sustainability of fast growing (mega)cities 
In the current "urban millennium", improved sustainability of ( mega)cities is a global imperative. 
If cities cannot be made sustainable, global sustainability wil l not succeed (WBGU 2016). 
(Mega)cities can be conceptualised as complex adaptive systems in nodal position of global 
urban networks (Butsch et al. 2016, Kraas et al. 2019). Due to the large concentration of 
population, infrastructure, political and socio-economic primac y, combined with high urban 
transformation dynamics, (mega)ci ties are strongly at risk by m ultiple natural and human-made 
disasters (Kraas 2008, Nicholls et al. 2008). Strengthening the transformative power of 
(mega)cities by integrative, holistic approaches of modern risk research thus contributes to 
more resilient societies and livelihoods (Garschagen et al. 201 4, Solecki/Pelling/Garschagen 
2017). Securing critical infrastructure (e.g. water, food and m edical supply, transportation and 
electricity) are even in “normal” times difficult to manage, pa rticularly in (mega)cities of the 
Global South, let alone in situations of disaster. Socio-econom ic deficits (e.g. social 
fragmentation and poverty) and unregulated, informal processes reinforce challenges of 
governance (Bohle/Sakdapolrak 2008, Heinrichs et al. 2012, Kraa s et al. 2019). 
The situation described above also applies to the greater regio n of Southeast Asia, where 
accelerated urbanization processes (in various countries with a time lag) began to take hold 
increasingly from the mid-1980s onwards. The percentage of urba n population in Southeast 
Asia rose from 15.6% (1950), 25.5% (1980) and 37.9% (2000) to 4 4.3% (2010) and 50.0% 
(2020), that of Myanmar even more strongly since the 2011 openi ng policy, namely from 16.2% 
(1950), 24.0% (1980) and 27.0% (2000) to 28.9% (2010) and 31.1% (2020) (WUP 2018). 
Myanmar – which is in the focus of the research project – is lo cated in a natural hazard-prone 
area. The Sagaing fault line runs through the middle of the cou ntry and is known for its high 
seismic activity and for frequent earthquakes (Thein et al. 200 9). The three most important 
(mega)cities Yangon, Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw are located direc tly on the Sagaing fault line, 
many regional cities Taunggyi and Mawlamyine are situated on si de fault lines (Kraas et al. 
2017). Myanmar also is highly exposed to tropical cyclones, whi ch develop in front of the 
coastal areas by (pre- and post-)monsoonal divergent air masses from land and ocean origin. 
Tropical cyclones reach the coasts with high velocities and can penetrate deeply into the 
country. Within the last 15 year s, Myanmar was affected by five very severe tropical cyclones: 
Nargis (May 2008), Giri (Oct 2010), Komen (Aug 2015), Maarutha (May 2017) and Bulbul (Oct

If cities cannot be made sustainable, global sustainability wil l not succeed (WBGU 2016). 
(Mega)cities can be conceptualised as complex adaptive systems in nodal position of global 
urban networks (Butsch et al. 2016, Kraas et al. 2019). Due to the large concentration of 
population, infrastructure, political and socio-economic primac y, combined with high urban 
transformation dynamics, (mega)ci ties are strongly at risk by m ultiple natural and human-made 
disasters (Kraas 2008, Nicholls et al. 2008). Strengthening the transformative power of 
(mega)cities by integrative, holistic approaches of modern risk research thus contributes to 
more resilient societies and livelihoods (Garschagen et al. 201 4, Solecki/Pelling/Garschagen 
2017). Securing critical infrastructure (e.g. water, food and m edical supply, transportation and 
electricity) are even in “normal” times difficult to manage, pa rticularly in (mega)cities of the 
Global South, let alone in situations of disaster. Socio-econom ic deficits (e.g. social 
fragmentation and poverty) and unregulated, informal processes reinforce challenges of 
governance (Bohle/Sakdapolrak 2008, Heinrichs et al. 2012, Kraa s et al. 2019). 
The situation described above also applies to the greater regio n of Southeast Asia, where 
accelerated urbanization processes (in various countries with a time lag) began to take hold 
increasingly from the mid-1980s onwards. The percentage of urba n population in Southeast 
Asia rose from 15.6% (1950), 25.5% (1980) and 37.9% (2000) to 4 4.3% (2010) and 50.0% 
(2020), that of Myanmar even more strongly since the 2011 openi ng policy, namely from 16.2% 
(1950), 24.0% (1980) and 27.0% (2000) to 28.9% (2010) and 31.1% (2020) (WUP 2018). 
Myanmar – which is in the focus of the research project – is lo cated in a natural hazard-prone 
area. The Sagaing fault line runs through the middle of the cou ntry and is known for its high 
seismic activity and for frequent earthquakes (Thein et al. 200 9). The three most important 
(mega)cities Yangon, Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw are located direc tly on the Sagaing fault line, 
many regional cities Taunggyi and Mawlamyine are situated on si de fault lines (Kraas et al. 
2017). Myanmar also is highly exposed to tropical cyclones, whi ch develop in front of the 
coastal areas by (pre- and post-)monsoonal divergent air masses from land and ocean origin. 
Tropical cyclones reach the coasts with high velocities and can penetrate deeply into the 
country. Within the last 15 year s, Myanmar was affected by five very severe tropical cyclones:

urban networks (Butsch et al. 2016, Kraas et al. 2019). Due to the large concentration of 
population, infrastructure, political and socio-economic primac y, combined with high urban 
transformation dynamics, (mega)ci ties are strongly at risk by m ultiple natural and human-made 
disasters (Kraas 2008, Nicholls et al. 2008). Strengthening the transformative power of 
(mega)cities by integrative, holistic approaches of modern risk research thus contributes to 
more resilient societies and livelihoods (Garschagen et al. 201 4, Solecki/Pelling/Garschagen 
2017). Securing critical infrastructure (e.g. water, food and m edical supply, transportation and 
electricity) are even in “normal” times difficult to manage, pa rticularly in (mega)cities of the 
Global South, let alone in situations of disaster. Socio-econom ic deficits (e.g. social 
fragmentation and poverty) and unregulated, informal processes reinforce challenges of 
governance (Bohle/Sakdapolrak 2008, Heinrichs et al. 2012, Kraa s et al. 2019). 
The situation described above also applies to the greater regio n of Southeast Asia, where 
accelerated urbanization processes (in various countries with a time lag) began to take hold 
increasingly from the mid-1980s onwards. The percentage of urba n population in Southeast 
Asia rose from 15.6% (1950), 25.5% (1980) and 37.9% (2000) to 4 4.3% (2010) and 50.0% 
(2020), that of Myanmar even more strongly since the 2011 openi ng policy, namely from 16.2% 
(1950), 24.0% (1980) and 27.0% (2000) to 28.9% (2010) and 31.1% (2020) (WUP 2018). 
Myanmar – which is in the focus of the research project – is lo cated in a natural hazard-prone 
area. The Sagaing fault line runs through the middle of the cou ntry and is known for its high 
seismic activity and for frequent earthquakes (Thein et al. 200 9). The three most important 
(mega)cities Yangon, Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw are located direc tly on the Sagaing fault line, 
many regional cities Taunggyi and Mawlamyine are situated on si de fault lines (Kraas et al. 
2017). Myanmar also is highly exposed to tropical cyclones, whi ch develop in front of the 
coastal areas by (pre- and post-)monsoonal divergent air masses from land and ocean origin. 
Tropical cyclones reach the coasts with high velocities and can penetrate deeply into the 
country. Within the last 15 year s, Myanmar was affected by five very severe tropical cyclones: 
Nargis (May 2008), Giri (Oct 2010), Komen (Aug 2015), Maarutha (May 2017) and Bulbul (Oct

1.1 Multiple risks – challenges for the sustainability of fast growing (mega)cities 
In the current "urban millennium", improved sustainability of ( mega)cities is a global imperative. 
If cities cannot be made sustainable, global sustainability wil l not succeed (WBGU 2016). 
(Mega)cities can be conceptualised as complex adaptive systems in nodal position of global 
urban networks (Butsch et al. 2016, Kraas et al. 2019). Due to the large concentration of
