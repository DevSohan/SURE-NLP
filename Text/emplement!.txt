In the course of the 21st century, the majority of the world population will live in cities. Asia has one 
of the highest urbanisation rates in the world, and Vietnam's cities are among the fastest growing 
in Asia. Cities embody some of the most pressing so cietal challenges: the provision of necessary 
and sustainable basic infrastructure and services, such as water supply, sanitation, waste manage- 
ment, energy and mobility (OECD 2018). Cities are f acing increasing resource depletion - including 
land resources - and environmental degradation, oft en extending far beyond city boundaries. 
In order to respond to these challenges, cities inc reasingly need to meet the requirements of sus- 
tainability and/ or resilience. Where sustainabilit y aims to rebalance the world permanently, resili- 
ence looks for ways to cope with an unbalanced worl d. Accordingly, sustainability and resilience 
have to go hand in hand (Arup 2015). 
Cities are often closely intertwined with the peri- urban and rural areas surrounding them, whether 
in terms of the flows of people, goods, products an d information, or transport, the use of resources, 
or the problems caused by lack of sustainability an d the associated vulnerability. This also applies 
to the resulting challenges: 
− Scarcity and depletion of energy, water and other resources (requires sustainable and socially respon sible 
planning and provision of technical infrastructure and measures focusing on resource efficiency) 
− Increasing destruction of natural environment (req uires sustainable and appropriate land use concepts ) 
− Climate change (requires mitigation and adaptation measures) 
− Migration towards cities (requires appropriate inf rastructure, housing) 
In the context of rapid urbanisation, planning and implementation must be able to keep up with this 
pace, including and in particular as regards infras tructure. Not only the quality of infrastructure an d 
services is important, but also the speed with whic h they are provided. It requires both forward 
planning and an appropriate understanding of the dy namics of urban development in order to avoid 
infrastructure decisions that force cities into inf lexible concepts designed only to deal with short-
term problems. Urban development that leads to sust ainable, resource-efficient solutions requires 
cooperation across hierarchies, sectors, technologi es and projects. 
The OECD Policy Review Vietnam (2018) notes that Vi etnam's urban population has almost dou- 
bled since 1990 mainly due to rural-urban migration . This also applies to the emplement! project 
area, the city of Da Nang (2018: 1.1 million inhabi tants; 2030: 2.5 million) and the neighbouring 
Quang Nam Province (2018: 1.5 million) with the cap ital Tam Ky. The challenges posed by this 
rapid growth must be met by efficient planning. Wit h this in mind, numerous strategies (green 
growth, resilience, etc.) as well as master plans f or Vietnamese cities have been developed. Their 
often very ambitious designs and the adherence of r igid standards often lead to unrealistic, unaf- 
fordable concepts which are consequently hardly fea sible (Vietnam National Report 2016).

in Asia. Cities embody some of the most pressing so cietal challenges: the provision of necessary 
and sustainable basic infrastructure and services, such as water supply, sanitation, waste manage- 
ment, energy and mobility (OECD 2018). Cities are f acing increasing resource depletion - including 
land resources - and environmental degradation, oft en extending far beyond city boundaries. 
In order to respond to these challenges, cities inc reasingly need to meet the requirements of sus- 
tainability and/ or resilience. Where sustainabilit y aims to rebalance the world permanently, resili- 
ence looks for ways to cope with an unbalanced worl d. Accordingly, sustainability and resilience 
have to go hand in hand (Arup 2015). 
Cities are often closely intertwined with the peri- urban and rural areas surrounding them, whether 
in terms of the flows of people, goods, products an d information, or transport, the use of resources, 
or the problems caused by lack of sustainability an d the associated vulnerability. This also applies 
to the resulting challenges: 
− Scarcity and depletion of energy, water and other resources (requires sustainable and socially respon sible 
planning and provision of technical infrastructure and measures focusing on resource efficiency) 
− Increasing destruction of natural environment (req uires sustainable and appropriate land use concepts ) 
− Climate change (requires mitigation and adaptation measures) 
− Migration towards cities (requires appropriate inf rastructure, housing) 
In the context of rapid urbanisation, planning and implementation must be able to keep up with this 
pace, including and in particular as regards infras tructure. Not only the quality of infrastructure an d 
services is important, but also the speed with whic h they are provided. It requires both forward 
planning and an appropriate understanding of the dy namics of urban development in order to avoid 
infrastructure decisions that force cities into inf lexible concepts designed only to deal with short-
term problems. Urban development that leads to sust ainable, resource-efficient solutions requires 
cooperation across hierarchies, sectors, technologi es and projects. 
The OECD Policy Review Vietnam (2018) notes that Vi etnam's urban population has almost dou- 
bled since 1990 mainly due to rural-urban migration . This also applies to the emplement! project 
area, the city of Da Nang (2018: 1.1 million inhabi tants; 2030: 2.5 million) and the neighbouring 
Quang Nam Province (2018: 1.5 million) with the cap ital Tam Ky. The challenges posed by this 
rapid growth must be met by efficient planning. Wit h this in mind, numerous strategies (green 
growth, resilience, etc.) as well as master plans f or Vietnamese cities have been developed. Their 
often very ambitious designs and the adherence of r igid standards often lead to unrealistic, unaf- 
fordable concepts which are consequently hardly fea sible (Vietnam National Report 2016).

in Asia. Cities embody some of the most pressing so cietal challenges: the provision of necessary 
and sustainable basic infrastructure and services, such as water supply, sanitation, waste manage- 
ment, energy and mobility (OECD 2018). Cities are f acing increasing resource depletion - including 
land resources - and environmental degradation, oft en extending far beyond city boundaries. 
In order to respond to these challenges, cities inc reasingly need to meet the requirements of sus- 
tainability and/ or resilience. Where sustainabilit y aims to rebalance the world permanently, resili- 
ence looks for ways to cope with an unbalanced worl d. Accordingly, sustainability and resilience 
have to go hand in hand (Arup 2015). 
Cities are often closely intertwined with the peri- urban and rural areas surrounding them, whether 
in terms of the flows of people, goods, products an d information, or transport, the use of resources, 
or the problems caused by lack of sustainability an d the associated vulnerability. This also applies 
to the resulting challenges: 
− Scarcity and depletion of energy, water and other resources (requires sustainable and socially respon sible 
planning and provision of technical infrastructure and measures focusing on resource efficiency) 
− Increasing destruction of natural environment (req uires sustainable and appropriate land use concepts ) 
− Climate change (requires mitigation and adaptation measures) 
− Migration towards cities (requires appropriate inf rastructure, housing) 
In the context of rapid urbanisation, planning and implementation must be able to keep up with this 
pace, including and in particular as regards infras tructure. Not only the quality of infrastructure an d 
services is important, but also the speed with whic h they are provided. It requires both forward 
planning and an appropriate understanding of the dy namics of urban development in order to avoid 
infrastructure decisions that force cities into inf lexible concepts designed only to deal with short-
term problems. Urban development that leads to sust ainable, resource-efficient solutions requires 
cooperation across hierarchies, sectors, technologi es and projects. 
The OECD Policy Review Vietnam (2018) notes that Vi etnam's urban population has almost dou- 
bled since 1990 mainly due to rural-urban migration . This also applies to the emplement! project 
area, the city of Da Nang (2018: 1.1 million inhabi tants; 2030: 2.5 million) and the neighbouring 
Quang Nam Province (2018: 1.5 million) with the cap ital Tam Ky. The challenges posed by this 
rapid growth must be met by efficient planning. Wit h this in mind, numerous strategies (green 
growth, resilience, etc.) as well as master plans f or Vietnamese cities have been developed. Their 
often very ambitious designs and the adherence of r igid standards often lead to unrealistic, unaf- 
fordable concepts which are consequently hardly fea sible (Vietnam National Report 2016). 
Many international organizations support cities lik e Da Nang in developing strategies to strengthen 
their resilience or to promote a "green" economy. W ithin the framework of these strategies, many 
important goals are defined. However, in terms of p ractical implementation, e.g. with regard to the
