
There is an increasing worldwide reception of the ecosystem services (ES)-framework in 
urban planning. Germany actively fosters Green Infrastructure(GI) utilizing ES terminology 
on all levels of spatial planning. In China, the central government now streamlines an eco- 
system -based approach of environmental governance accompanied by major institutional 
reforms. Surprisingly, in both countries, there is a substantial lack of an up-to-date con- 
ceptualization of ES. Research in the policy -science interface is needed focusing on ex- 
plicit policy goals, inclusion of relevant stakeholders, representative and thorough data 
coverage, and iterative development of ES toolboxes. IMECOGIP will substantially allevi- 
ate this deficit. As a major result of the definition phase, we stated the different degrees of 
integration of the ES concept into urban planning and- especially - into GI planning in the 
two regional, socio -cultural and political contexts of China(Shanghai) and Germany(Ruhr 
area). In the latter, we detected a discrepancy between the planning levels, where ES- 
thinking has not yet inspired planning routines connected to land use and GI planning 
(zoning plans, landscape plans, Environmental Impact Assessment, compensation mech - 
anisms, etc.). In a joint Sino -German action, the IMECOGIP research group determined 
8 most significant and 14 significant ES for Shanghai and the Ruhr area and graded the 
ES supply of specific land use/land cover classes(LULC) in a qualitative manner. Further- 
more, the group was able to compile a huge body of high quality data with a high spatial 
resolution(< 1 m) that enable quantitative ES assessments in Shanghai and the Ruhr area. 
During the R&D- Phase IMECOGIP will develop a user-friendly, scientifically sound and 
spatially explicit open source toolbox to assess and evaluate ES (demand and supply), 
synergies and trade -offs in the context of GI for different urban development scenarios; 
The toolbox will allow for comparative evaluations of ES-conformity of different planning 
scenarios. We will develop and test methods how GI planning can be improved by applying 
ES principles in real word cases studies and using Big Data. The principal purpose is to 
strengthen urban resilience. 
To that end, we can rely on a consortium of distinguished researchers in three Chinese 
research institutions with far-reaching relationships to provincial and local planning. The 
IMECOGIP network is backed- up by nine cooperation agreements (MOUs). In Germany,

There is an increasing worldwide reception of the ecosystem services (ES)-framework in 
urban planning. Germany actively fosters Green Infrastructure(GI) utilizing ES terminology 
on all levels of spatial planning. In China, the central government now streamlines an eco- 
system -based approach of environmental governance accompanied by major institutional 
reforms. Surprisingly, in both countries, there is a substantial lack of an up-to-date con- 
ceptualization of ES. Research in the policy -science interface is needed focusing on ex- 
plicit policy goals, inclusion of relevant stakeholders, representative and thorough data 
coverage, and iterative development of ES toolboxes. IMECOGIP will substantially allevi- 
ate this deficit. As a major result of the definition phase, we stated the different degrees of 
integration of the ES concept into urban planning and- especially - into GI planning in the 
two regional, socio -cultural and political contexts of China(Shanghai) and Germany(Ruhr 
area). In the latter, we detected a discrepancy between the planning levels, where ES- 
thinking has not yet inspired planning routines connected to land use and GI planning 
(zoning plans, landscape plans, Environmental Impact Assessment, compensation mech - 
anisms, etc.). In a joint Sino -German action, the IMECOGIP research group determined 
8 most significant and 14 significant ES for Shanghai and the Ruhr area and graded the 
ES supply of specific land use/land cover classes(LULC) in a qualitative manner. Further- 
more, the group was able to compile a huge body of high quality data with a high spatial 
resolution(< 1 m) that enable quantitative ES assessments in Shanghai and the Ruhr area. 
During the R&D- Phase IMECOGIP will develop a user-friendly, scientifically sound and 
spatially explicit open source toolbox to assess and evaluate ES (demand and supply), 
synergies and trade -offs in the context of GI for different urban development scenarios; 
The toolbox will allow for comparative evaluations of ES-conformity of different planning 
scenarios. We will develop and test methods how GI planning can be improved by applying 
ES principles in real word cases studies and using Big Data. The principal purpose is to 
strengthen urban resilience.
