The initiative “Carrying heritage buildings as part of urban regions into a modern and energy-efficient society 
(CHARMS)” develops an integrated urban development strat egy for improving the thermal comfort of historic 
houses and neighborhoods in the urban region of Chiang Mai. In the light of the planning paradigm of 
preservation through use, locally adapted, sustainable usage concepts for historic wooden houses are 
developed and their implementation prepared. First, climate models of various urban climatic levels are developed. The climate analysis is enriched with the 
comparative analysis of the attitudes of urban and rural residents of historic districts on the subject of energy 
and resource efficient building renovation. The ecological and social effectiveness of the solutions developed 
in the project is assessed based on these climate and social structure models. The development of locally 
adapted solutions is based on innovation challenges, understood as short solution-oriented experimental projects that propose solutions from the perspective of building materials, the building structure, the urban microclimate, the municipal communication infrastructure and the standardization of municipal decision-
making processes. This process is accompanied by the ASE AN-wide identification of social innovations to 
improve thermal comfort, as well as the ASEAN-wide im plementation of capacity-development activities with 
universities from countries confronted with comparable challenges. The technical and social innovations are presented to an expert and to a community advisory board and adjusted according to their feedback. The 
focus of the last two project years is the political and scientific utilization of the project results and the 
preparation of the economically viable implementation of the integrated urban development strategy in the 
subsequent implementation phase based on an innovation strategy. CHARMS contributes to the implementation of the green economy, future city , German Energiewende and 
links ecology with economy and social aspects. CHARMS operationalizes the national sustainability strategy 
(new edition 2016) and the German high-tech strategy. The project also makes a contribution to the 
implementation of the "Goals for Sustainable Development of the United Nations (SDGs)", especially Goal 7 
(Energy for all), Goal 11 (Sustainable cities) and goal 17 (Global partnership for sustainable development) 
2. PROBLEM ANALYSIS 
Focal problem: Unhealthy and uncomfortable thermal environments provided by traditional, wooden buildings in Thailand impair local resident’s wellbeing 
Research conducted by the CHARMS team in 2019 shows that the use value that residents in Chiang 
Mai/Northern Thailand, attribute to wooden, traditional resi dential buildings is impaired by the unsatisfactory 
indoor comfort these buildings provide. This problem is further evidenced by a convenience-sample based pilot survey with 119 respondents from the pilot districts of Wat Lam Chang and Wat Ket conducted in 2020 (thereof 52 residents of wooden buildings). With future developments in mind it is important to note that the results indicate a generation split in terms of percepti ons of the indoor comfort provided by traditional wooden 
building with the younger generation having a more negative view on this issue than the older generation (Fig 
1). At the same time, the results indicate that the existence and future use of these buildings are of utmost importance for the sake of the cultural identity of the local inhabitants (with almost 80 percent approval among those respondents, who do not live in traditional wooden buildings).

2. PROBLEM ANALYSIS 
Focal problem: Unhealthy and uncomfortable thermal environments provided by traditional, wooden buildings in Thailand impair local resident’s wellbeing 
Research conducted by the CHARMS team in 2019 shows that the use value that residents in Chiang 
Mai/Northern Thailand, attribute to wooden, traditional resi dential buildings is impaired by the unsatisfactory 
indoor comfort these buildings provide. This problem is further evidenced by a convenience-sample based pilot survey with 119 respondents from the pilot districts of Wat Lam Chang and Wat Ket conducted in 2020 (thereof 52 residents of wooden buildings). With future developments in mind it is important to note that the results indicate a generation split in terms of percepti ons of the indoor comfort provided by traditional wooden 
building with the younger generation having a more negative view on this issue than the older generation (Fig 
1). At the same time, the results indicate that the existence and future use of these buildings are of utmost importance for the sake of the cultural identity of the local inhabitants (with almost 80 percent approval among those respondents, who do not live in traditional wooden buildings). The initiative “Carrying heritage buildings as part of urban regions into a modern and energy-efficient society 
(CHARMS)” develops an integrated urban development strat egy for improving the thermal comfort of historic 
houses and neighborhoods in the urban region of Chiang Mai. In the light of the planning paradigm of 
preservation through use, locally adapted, sustainable usage concepts for historic wooden houses are 
developed and their implementation prepared. First, climate models of various urban climatic levels are developed. The climate analysis is enriched with the 
comparative analysis of the attitudes of urban and rural residents of historic districts on the subject of energy 
and resource efficient building renovation. The ecological and social effectiveness of the solutions developed 
in the project is assessed based on these climate and social structure models. The development of locally 
adapted solutions is based on innovation challenges, understood as short solution-oriented experimental projects that propose solutions from the perspective of building materials, the building structure, the urban microclimate, the municipal communication infrastructure and the standardization of municipal decision-

2. PROBLEM ANALYSIS 
Focal problem: Unhealthy and uncomfortable thermal environments provided by traditional, wooden buildings in Thailand impair local resident’s wellbeing 
Research conducted by the CHARMS team in 2019 shows that the use value that residents in Chiang 
Mai/Northern Thailand, attribute to wooden, traditional resi dential buildings is impaired by the unsatisfactory 
indoor comfort these buildings provide. This problem is further evidenced by a convenience-sample based pilot survey with 119 respondents from the pilot districts of Wat Lam Chang and Wat Ket conducted in 2020 (thereof 52 residents of wooden buildings). With future developments in mind it is important to note that the results indicate a generation split in terms of percepti ons of the indoor comfort provided by traditional wooden 
building with the younger generation having a more negative view on this issue than the older generation (Fig 
1). At the same time, the results indicate that the existence and future use of these buildings are of utmost importance for the sake of the cultural identity of the local inhabitants (with almost 80 percent approval among those respondents, who do not live in traditional wooden buildings). The initiative “Carrying heritage buildings as part of urban regions into a modern and energy-efficient society 
(CHARMS)” develops an integrated urban development strat egy for improving the thermal comfort of historic 
houses and neighborhoods in the urban region of Chiang Mai. In the light of the planning paradigm of 
preservation through use, locally adapted, sustainable usage concepts for historic wooden houses are 
developed and their implementation prepared. First, climate models of various urban climatic levels are developed. The climate analysis is enriched with the 
comparative analysis of the attitudes of urban and rural residents of historic districts on the subject of energy 
and resource efficient building renovation. The ecological and social effectiveness of the solutions developed 
in the project is assessed based on these climate and social structure models. The development of locally 
adapted solutions is based on innovation challenges, understood as short solution-oriented experimental projects that propose solutions from the perspective of building materials, the building structure, the urban microclimate, the municipal communication infrastructure and the standardization of municipal decision-
making processes. This process is accompanied by the ASE AN-wide identification of social innovations to 
improve thermal comfort, as well as the ASEAN-wide im plementation of capacity-development activities with 
universities from countries confronted with comparable challenges. The technical and social innovations are presented to an expert and to a community advisory board and adjusted according to their feedback. The 
focus of the last two project years is the political and scientific utilization of the project results and the 
preparation of the economically viable implementation of the integrated urban development strategy in the 
subsequent implementation phase based on an innovation strategy. CHARMS contributes to the implementation of the green economy, future city , German Energiewende and 
links ecology with economy and social aspects. CHARMS operationalizes the national sustainability strategy
