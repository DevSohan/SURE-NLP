
The project GreenCityLabHu ế aims to s trengthen the climate resilience of the city of Hue (Thua 
Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam ) through nature -based solutions (NBS) with a focus on 
heat adaptation and air quality improvement . It will create a multidisciplinary research and 
experimental space to develop, test, visuali se, discuss and implement ideas and concepts on the 
restoration and expansion of green -blue infrastructure (GBI) , and thus for the promotion and 
implementation of NBS , in the urban area of Hue. In cooperation with stakeholders from science, 
politics , administration, and civil society, the international project consortium of Independent 
Institute for Environmental Issues (UfU) , Humboldt -Universität zu Berlin ( HUB), Mientrung 
Institute for Scientific Research (MISR ), Thua Thien Hue Institute for Development Studies 
(HueIDS) , and the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Sciences /Hue University 
(HUSC) will generate joint knowledge for stakeholders and decision -makers on NBS, resulting in 
a city-wide vision – a strategy contain ing guiding principles and best -practice recommendations 
for a greener , more resilient , and sustainable urban development of Hue , including proposals for 
specific measures of GBI implementation . 
By providing information and scenarios based on qualitative research, multilayer GIS modelling, 
impact assessment , and the Urban Learning Lab (ULL) approach via the Green City Lab Hue 
(GCLH) , and the project website , the project will inspire stakeholders , and decision -makers in 
Hue and other Vietnamese cities to mainstream GBI development into their urban planning 
processes. Thereby, k nowledge transfer , and p articipation of stakeholders and the public in 
scenario development and planning process es will create co-learning opportunities and build up 
capacities for co -creation among administration , science , and the public . 
During its definition phase, the GreenCityLabHuế project compiled a typology on GBI elements 
and, based on this, first narratives and scenarios for GBI development in Hue , and conducted 
initial research on the current situation and preconditions for future developments of GBI in Hue , 
which were summarised in the project’s status quo report. The generated knowledge resulted in 
advancements and adaption s of the project design for the Research and Development ( R&D) 
phase in particular the specification of the project’s focus towards heat adaptation and air quality 
improvement , the inclusion of practical showcases , and the involvement of additional Vietnamese 
partner s. The R&D -phase will prioriti se the revision of land-use change models, carry out an 
impact assessment, implement participatory co-design and co -learning process es combined with 
practical NBS showcases, and develop the Green City Vision Hue for future GBI development

The project GreenCityLabHu ế aims to s trengthen the climate resilience of the city of Hue (Thua 
Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam ) through nature -based solutions (NBS) with a focus on 
heat adaptation and air quality improvement . It will create a multidisciplinary research and 
experimental space to develop, test, visuali se, discuss and implement ideas and concepts on the 
restoration and expansion of green -blue infrastructure (GBI) , and thus for the promotion and 
implementation of NBS , in the urban area of Hue. In cooperation with stakeholders from science, 
politics , administration, and civil society, the international project consortium of Independent 
Institute for Environmental Issues (UfU) , Humboldt -Universität zu Berlin ( HUB), Mientrung 
Institute for Scientific Research (MISR ), Thua Thien Hue Institute for Development Studies 
(HueIDS) , and the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Sciences /Hue University 
(HUSC) will generate joint knowledge for stakeholders and decision -makers on NBS, resulting in 
a city-wide vision – a strategy contain ing guiding principles and best -practice recommendations 
for a greener , more resilient , and sustainable urban development of Hue , including proposals for 
specific measures of GBI implementation . 
By providing information and scenarios based on qualitative research, multilayer GIS modelling, 
impact assessment , and the Urban Learning Lab (ULL) approach via the Green City Lab Hue 
(GCLH) , and the project website , the project will inspire stakeholders , and decision -makers in 
Hue and other Vietnamese cities to mainstream GBI development into their urban planning 
processes. Thereby, k nowledge transfer , and p articipation of stakeholders and the public in 
scenario development and planning process es will create co-learning opportunities and build up 
capacities for co -creation among administration , science , and the public .
