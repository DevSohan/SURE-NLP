1. Justification of the identified research problems 
1.1 Updated regional compelling problems, planning trends and actions 
Several decades of research ha ve produced considerable understanding of the complex and interacting con-
sequences in global climate change and fast urbanization development (IPCC, 2014; UN, 2017; UN ISDR, 
2015). However, strategic risk reduction has not g ained significant traction in international debates, particu-
larly in regard to informal settlements in the Global South where large gaps remain between the demands of 
the public, scientific studies and policy making (Garschagen, et al, 2020). While often r ecognised as one of 
the most ‘at risk’ places, informal settlements have been directly and indirectly excluded from many formal 
mechanisms, thereby increasing their vulnerability to disaster events ( Morin , et al., 2016, Greiving, et. al., 
2018). This challenge is particularly troublesome for the emerging economies of Southeast Asia, including 
the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand, where the prevalen ce of urban informality coincides with extremely 
high exposure to natural hazards (Birkmann and Welle et al. 2016). 
Three countries with conjunction of informality and hazard exposure were selected to demonstrate a breadth 
of historically and socio -politically grounded planning contexts in which to test the transferability of the pro-
ject’s findings and proposed interventions. The first is Metro Manila , the largest and fastest growing metro-
politan area in the Philippines. The metropolitan region has for dec ades attracted migrants from the prov-
inces, not all of whom have found formal housing. National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA, 
2017) estimated that there were 2.8 million informal settlers, or 556,526 informal settler families (ISFs), living 
in Metro Manila. Out of this number, 104,000 families are occupying areas identified as danger zones, such 
as railroad tracks, garbage dumps, canals, rivers and creeks and other flood -prone areas. Many of these 
ISFs also live in houses made of light materials , and are therefore particularly vulnerable. Despite precarious 
living situation of ISFs, disaster -driven upgrading is currently still a low priority of planning in the Philippines. 
In large part , however, the focus is on finding large scale, lasting solut ions to this perennial problem, yet 
these often entail moving people far from their livelihoods and thus have limited success. As such, there is a 
demand for new approaches and insights that help gain traction on how to support effective upgrading and/or 
retreat in the current context. 
Hanoi has a similar situation to Metro Manila in terms of hazard exposure (mostly flooding) and re-developing 
informal settlements. Along with the growing trends of immigration into Hanoi, it has been argued that hazard 
prone areas are an integral part of Hanoi's migration dynamic in that it creates the conditions that have made 
certain areas of the city affordable, thus enabling settlement by low -income people (Anh and Minh, 2017). 
The majority of migrants, especially migran ts without residential registration, have no opportunity to access 
any information from district -level authorities, and thus lack the support that is being offered to formal resi-
dents from district -level government. Though informal settlements are decreasi ng as a result of the general 
ing provinces as a chance to accommodate future resettlement; preparin g for peripheral mid -size cities’ 
growth; diverging urban growth into other regional metro -areas so as to augment growth absorption.

1. Justification of the identified research problems 
1.1 Updated regional compelling problems, planning trends and actions 
Several decades of research ha ve produced considerable understanding of the complex and interacting con-
sequences in global climate change and fast urbanization development (IPCC, 2014; UN, 2017; UN ISDR, 
2015). However, strategic risk reduction has not g ained significant traction in international debates, particu-
larly in regard to informal settlements in the Global South where large gaps remain between the demands of 
the public, scientific studies and policy making (Garschagen, et al, 2020). While often r ecognised as one of 
the most ‘at risk’ places, informal settlements have been directly and indirectly excluded from many formal 
mechanisms, thereby increasing their vulnerability to disaster events ( Morin , et al., 2016, Greiving, et. al., 
2018). This challenge is particularly troublesome for the emerging economies of Southeast Asia, including 
the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand, where the prevalen ce of urban informality coincides with extremely 
high exposure to natural hazards (Birkmann and Welle et al. 2016). 
Three countries with conjunction of informality and hazard exposure were selected to demonstrate a breadth 
of historically and socio -politically grounded planning contexts in which to test the transferability of the pro-
ject’s findings and proposed interventions. The first is Metro Manila , the largest and fastest growing metro-
politan area in the Philippines. The metropolitan region has for dec ades attracted migrants from the prov-
inces, not all of whom have found formal housing. National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA, 
2017) estimated that there were 2.8 million informal settlers, or 556,526 informal settler families (ISFs), living 
in Metro Manila. Out of this number, 104,000 families are occupying areas identified as danger zones, such 
as railroad tracks, garbage dumps, canals, rivers and creeks and other flood -prone areas. Many of these 
ISFs also live in houses made of light materials , and are therefore particularly vulnerable. Despite precarious 
living situation of ISFs, disaster -driven upgrading is currently still a low priority of planning in the Philippines. 
In large part , however, the focus is on finding large scale, lasting solut ions to this perennial problem, yet 
these often entail moving people far from their livelihoods and thus have limited success. As such, there is a 
demand for new approaches and insights that help gain traction on how to support effective upgrading and/or 
retreat in the current context. 
Hanoi has a similar situation to Metro Manila in terms of hazard exposure (mostly flooding) and re-developing 
informal settlements. Along with the growing trends of immigration into Hanoi, it has been argued that hazard 
prone areas are an integral part of Hanoi's migration dynamic in that it creates the conditions that have made 
certain areas of the city affordable, thus enabling settlement by low -income people (Anh and Minh, 2017).

In large part , however, the focus is on finding large scale, lasting solut ions to this perennial problem, yet 
these often entail moving people far from their livelihoods and thus have limited success. As such, there is a 
demand for new approaches and insights that help gain traction on how to support effective upgrading and/or 
retreat in the current context. 
Hanoi has a similar situation to Metro Manila in terms of hazard exposure (mostly flooding) and re-developing 
informal settlements. Along with the growing trends of immigration into Hanoi, it has been argued that hazard 
prone areas are an integral part of Hanoi's migration dynamic in that it creates the conditions that have made 
certain areas of the city affordable, thus enabling settlement by low -income people (Anh and Minh, 2017). 
The majority of migrants, especially migran ts without residential registration, have no opportunity to access 
any information from district -level authorities, and thus lack the support that is being offered to formal resi-
dents from district -level government. Though informal settlements are decreasi ng as a result of the general 
ing provinces as a chance to accommodate future resettlement; preparin g for peripheral mid -size cities’ 
growth; diverging urban growth into other regional metro -areas so as to augment growth absorption. 
1. Justification of the identified research problems 
1.1 Updated regional compelling problems, planning trends and actions 
Several decades of research ha ve produced considerable understanding of the complex and interacting con-
sequences in global climate change and fast urbanization development (IPCC, 2014; UN, 2017; UN ISDR, 
2015). However, strategic risk reduction has not g ained significant traction in international debates, particu-
larly in regard to informal settlements in the Global South where large gaps remain between the demands of 
the public, scientific studies and policy making (Garschagen, et al, 2020). While often r ecognised as one of 
the most ‘at risk’ places, informal settlements have been directly and indirectly excluded from many formal 
mechanisms, thereby increasing their vulnerability to disaster events ( Morin , et al., 2016, Greiving, et. al., 
2018). This challenge is particularly troublesome for the emerging economies of Southeast Asia, including 
the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand, where the prevalen ce of urban informality coincides with extremely 
high exposure to natural hazards (Birkmann and Welle et al. 2016). 
Three countries with conjunction of informality and hazard exposure were selected to demonstrate a breadth 
of historically and socio -politically grounded planning contexts in which to test the transferability of the pro-
ject’s findings and proposed interventions. The first is Metro Manila , the largest and fastest growing metro-
politan area in the Philippines. The metropolitan region has for dec ades attracted migrants from the prov-
inces, not all of whom have found formal housing. National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA, 
2017) estimated that there were 2.8 million informal settlers, or 556,526 informal settler families (ISFs), living 
in Metro Manila. Out of this number, 104,000 families are occupying areas identified as danger zones, such 
as railroad tracks, garbage dumps, canals, rivers and creeks and other flood -prone areas. Many of these 
ISFs also live in houses made of light materials , and are therefore particularly vulnerable. Despite precarious 
living situation of ISFs, disaster -driven upgrading is currently still a low priority of planning in the Philippines.
