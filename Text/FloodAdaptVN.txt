1.1 Regional challenges and the need for act ion 
Typhoons and associated floods repeatedly hit Central Viet Nam, predominantly in autumn. Within 
the last two decades, catastrophic events took place in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013, 
2016 and typhoon “Doksuri” in 2017. In 2016, typhoon "Sar ika" and subsequent flood events left 
134 people dead and missing (UN 2016). In Central Viet Nam, 10- 30% of the population was 
affected, about one million people were in urgent need for support, and economic loss accounted 
for 460 million US$. In October 2019 and March 2020, extreme weather events resulted in four 
fatalities, over 5,000 damaged buildings and infrastructures, considerable loss of agri -/ 
aquacultural land and significant economic damage especially amongst small and mid- sized 
enterprises in ci ties/towns. As a result of climatic change, it is likely that extreme weather events 
will further intensify in magnitude and frequency (IPCC 2014, MONRE 2016, Bangalore et al. 
2019). Coastal cities are particularly threatened by flooding – and with them the economic basis 
and sustainability of their urban regions (Kulp et al. 2019). Climate change and flooding will also 
intensify impacts on water quality or spreading pathogens through waterborne transmission, with 
knock -on effects on both natural and human systems (Tran & Shaw 2007, Rui et al. 2018). The 
situation in Central Viet Nam is characterized by rapid urbanization, particularly in small and mid-
sized coastal cities (GSO 2016), which leads to (1) increased surface sealing and associated 
inundations following heavy rainfall, (2) loss of infiltration and retention areas generating higher 
runoff and flood depth, and (3) increased exposure through the expansion of settlements into 
flood -prone areas (Garschagen 2014, 2015, Sudmeier -Rieux et al. 2015, DiGreg orio et al. 2016). 
In Central Viet Nam, high urbanization trends co- occur with land use changes in the upper 
catchment of the rivers (Truong et al. 2018, Tamura et al. 2020). The consequences are dramatic 
as the coastal area is squeezed between the mountai nous upstream area and the sea, resulting 
in very short response times when heavy rainfall occurs. Due to changing settlement patterns, 
housing typologies and lifestyles (from rural to urban), combined with societal transformation, local 
vulnerabilities as well as adaptation practices are also changing and have to be considered 
(Garschagen & Kraas 2011, Pelling 2003, Carew -Reid 2008, Bloch et al. 2012). This dynamic and 
forward- looking perspective is not only relevant for preventive/adaptive planning, but particularly 
in a Covid -19 context, in which the virus and subsequent economic downturn have massive 
implications for future vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Local communities found ways to cope 
with recurring flood events by the construction of dams (e .g. upstream of city of Hue ), flood-
adapted housing, and channels for water drainage. Yet, as demonstrated by the severe impacts 
of past events, and as emphasized by local stakeholders in the Definition Phase, these efforts are 
not sufficient to prevent di sasters in the future. Instead, the development of new industrial and 
residential areas is still given priority by local decision- makers intending to boost the economy, 
while little incentives for risk -informed planning are provided (Garschagen 2016). Addi tionally, in

In Central Viet Nam, high urbanization trends co- occur with land use changes in the upper

of past events, and as emphasized by local stakeholders in the Definition Phase, these efforts are

Typhoons and associated floods repeatedly hit Central Viet Nam, predominantly in autumn. Within 
the last two decades, catastrophic events took place in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013, 
2016 and typhoon “Doksuri” in 2017. In 2016, typhoon "Sar ika" and subsequent flood events left 
134 people dead and missing (UN 2016). In Central Viet Nam, 10- 30% of the population was 
affected, about one million people were in urgent need for support, and economic loss accounted 
for 460 million US$. In October 2019 and March 2020, extreme weather events resulted in four 
fatalities, over 5,000 damaged buildings and infrastructures, considerable loss of agri -/ 
aquacultural land and significant economic damage especially amongst small and mid- sized 
enterprises in ci ties/towns. As a result of climatic change, it is likely that extreme weather events 
will further intensify in magnitude and frequency (IPCC 2014, MONRE 2016, Bangalore et al. 
2019). Coastal cities are particularly threatened by flooding – and with them the economic basis 
and sustainability of their urban regions (Kulp et al. 2019). Climate change and flooding will also 
intensify impacts on water quality or spreading pathogens through waterborne transmission, with 
knock -on effects on both natural and human systems (Tran & Shaw 2007, Rui et al. 2018). The 
situation in Central Viet Nam is characterized by rapid urbanization, particularly in small and mid-
sized coastal cities (GSO 2016), which leads to (1) increased surface sealing and associated 
inundations following heavy rainfall, (2) loss of infiltration and retention areas generating higher 
runoff and flood depth, and (3) increased exposure through the expansion of settlements into

the last two decades, catastrophic events took place in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013, 
2016 and typhoon “Doksuri” in 2017. In 2016, typhoon "Sar ika" and subsequent flood events left 
134 people dead and missing (UN 2016). In Central Viet Nam, 10- 30% of the population was 
affected, about one million people were in urgent need for support, and economic loss accounted 
for 460 million US$. In October 2019 and March 2020, extreme weather events resulted in four 
fatalities, over 5,000 damaged buildings and infrastructures, considerable loss of agri -/ 
aquacultural land and significant economic damage especially amongst small and mid- sized 
enterprises in ci ties/towns. As a result of climatic change, it is likely that extreme weather events 
will further intensify in magnitude and frequency (IPCC 2014, MONRE 2016, Bangalore et al. 
2019). Coastal cities are particularly threatened by flooding – and with them the economic basis 
and sustainability of their urban regions (Kulp et al. 2019). Climate change and flooding will also 
intensify impacts on water quality or spreading pathogens through waterborne transmission, with 
knock -on effects on both natural and human systems (Tran & Shaw 2007, Rui et al. 2018). The 
situation in Central Viet Nam is characterized by rapid urbanization, particularly in small and mid-
sized coastal cities (GSO 2016), which leads to (1) increased surface sealing and associated 
inundations following heavy rainfall, (2) loss of infiltration and retention areas generating higher 
runoff and flood depth, and (3) increased exposure through the expansion of settlements into 
flood -prone areas (Garschagen 2014, 2015, Sudmeier -Rieux et al. 2015, DiGreg orio et al. 2016). 
In Central Viet Nam, high urbanization trends co- occur with land use changes in the upper 
catchment of the rivers (Truong et al. 2018, Tamura et al. 2020). The consequences are dramatic 
as the coastal area is squeezed between the mountai nous upstream area and the sea, resulting 
in very short response times when heavy rainfall occurs. Due to changing settlement patterns, 
housing typologies and lifestyles (from rural to urban), combined with societal transformation, local 
vulnerabilities as well as adaptation practices are also changing and have to be considered 
(Garschagen & Kraas 2011, Pelling 2003, Carew -Reid 2008, Bloch et al. 2012). This dynamic and 
forward- looking perspective is not only relevant for preventive/adaptive planning, but particularly 
in a Covid -19 context, in which the virus and subsequent economic downturn have massive 
implications for future vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Local communities found ways to cope 
with recurring flood events by the construction of dams (e .g. upstream of city of Hue ), flood-
adapted housing, and channels for water drainage. Yet, as demonstrated by the severe impacts 
of past events, and as emphasized by local stakeholders in the Definition Phase, these efforts are 
not sufficient to prevent di sasters in the future. Instead, the development of new industrial and 
residential areas is still given priority by local decision- makers intending to boost the economy, 
while little incentives for risk -informed planning are provided (Garschagen 2016). Addi tionally, in
