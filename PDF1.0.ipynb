frequently unplanned urbanization significan tly accelerates supply gaps in  water  related municipal public services and the overexploitation of water resources has reached alarming levels  in many contexts  world bank group 2016  adb 2018 unescap 2019   because planning frameworks are  often highly  centralized sectoral and designed to fit within ideal typical planning cycles they are unable to  capture the complex and fast changing interface between water management and urban development needs  and address long  term changes    while global agendas such as sdgs or nua offer some orientation towards a holistic vision key obstacles are  a lacking knowledge base that connects a deep local understanding of current challenges and available  resources as well as cross  sectoral processes tools and c apacities to plan and steer effective transformation    gutterer and reuter 2016    polyurbwater seeks to develop tools and frameworks for cross  sectoral cooperation  that bridge existing silo approaches by bringing together different sectors and relevant sta keholders such as  public entities private sector communities civil society and academia  most integrated solutions are not solely  technical but rely heavily on both social  ecological and governance dimensions as well as the strong participation  of loca l stakeholders in planning processes as key drivers of change  polyurbwater

watson 2014  huchzezmeyer & misselwitz 2016     effective responses to current challenges require the ability to first acknowledge and then integrate a multiplicity  of predicaments that prevent positive and sustainable transitions  this multiplicity crystallizes in cities where  various  stakeholders have to generate  synergies and understand trade  offs between ecological social and  political transformation to anchor water  sensit ive development and climate action  the greatest challenge in  being able to achieve this aim is often not technology or capit al but rather a generation of knowledge the  integration of regulatory frameworks and the empowerment of practitioners with the right sensibilities skills and  conceptual agility to guide this transformation process  large cities are hard  pressed to find and train staff with  these capabilities for secondary and tertiary cities in sea this challenge is even more demanding   sheng 2010      a key sensitizing concept for the proposed research project is that of urban resilience which has become widely  used in  research and development contexts  meerow et al  2016  béné et al  2018   the great challenge of  resilience is that it is still a relatively abstract concept to many decision  makers in sea  due to its multi  sectoral  nature resilience is still difficul t to frame and relatively complex to

2016  emphasize the need to boost water  related resilience of  secondary and tertiary cities because  they frequently struggle s imultaneously with fast er population  growth high  vulnerability to climate change and environmental disasters lower budgets and weaker institutional capacities    a further characteristic of local urbanization frontiers of such cities  is the simultaneous presence of and  hybridiza tion between rural and urban lifestyles rural and urban organizational forms and  hierarchies including  decision  making structures  in planning literature this condition is often referred to as peri  urban or desakota   mc gee & shaharudin 2016   scholarly  research on the impact of this dynamically changing urbanization  frontier on water systems and related practices and lifestyles remains underdeveloped    a second sensitizing concept is the notion of polycentricity and polycentric approaches that the proje ct seeks to  apply to the management of urban waters  the idea of polycentric approaches builds on work from ostrom et  al   1961  which has since evolved to describe a complex form of governance wi th multiple centers of decision   making each of which oper ates with some degree of autonomy  carlisle & gruby 2017   the nua specifically  calls for integrated polycentric approaches that strengthen the role of small and intermediate cities   united  nations 2017  pp  24  however without definition of how this vision could be operationalized  this project  considers a water  sensitive polycentric approach to urban development to signify that multiple sectors work  together with various local public and private stakeholder groups integrating urban planning wit h water  management using centralized and decentralized approaches  such polycentric management of urban water  resources needs to include the various meanings of water in its social environmental and economic dimensions and  therefore requires the inclusion  of multiple stakeholder groups and the formulation of a collective water  sensitive vision  that can be governed from multiple centers of responsibility  neto 2016  narain et al  2018  bustillos evers &  ribbe  2019    here polyurbwater intends to co  create water  sensitive urban development scenarios with the pilot cities to  foster urban resilience and strive towards the localization of the sdgs     beyond the

cooperation agreements  lols attached      the major research findings of definition phase that were common to the three case studies are     all national development plans that guide planning in the three partner cities call for sdg localization or for  sdgs to be converted and implemented in a concrete urban development plan  in various forms the cities  have elaborated initial strategies to ma ke their cities liveable ecologically sustainable economically efficient  inclusive and climate friendly  they have identified the comprehensive and effective management of urban  water resources as a strategic element for this development      mainstream ur ban planning and development models such as the development and implementation of  centrally planned and managed technical infrastructure solutions are not sufficient to meet the changing  dynamics of the urban areas      various drivers and pressures related  to urban water resources have contributed to a system where the partner  cities struggle with the reliable provision of drinking water are unable to effectively manage wastewater and  stormwater and are unable to cope with extreme weather events  e g  dr oughts and floods       the municipal government structures have a limited capacity to actively shape urban transformation  processes which is reflected in the insufficient development of a management framework for urban water  resources  rapidly progressing l and use changes and poor solid waste management leads to flooding of  urban areas the washing out of existing sewage systems and water quality issues damaging both public  infrastructure and private property as well as threatening public health  diarrhea dengue etc        financeability and sustainable maintenance of effective water  sensitive infrastructure overwhelm the partner  cities  due to a lack of sufficient capacities mandates and financing instruments public  sector institutions act  reactively rathe r than proactively      due to insufficient inconsistent and fragmented regulatory frameworks and poorly coordinated mandates of public  bodies markets for decentralized systems are barely developed  operating models for existing wastewater  sectorial concepts in their realities   a high degree of flexibility modularity and polycentricity must be a key feature of water  sensitive infrastructure development for such cities  there is increasing awareness among city managers that the un principle of progressive implementation  evolving infrastructures  should guide infrastructure development  in reality this principle must be adequately defined according to the local context implemented and sustainably maintained hence there are onl y few precise ideas about this at the planning and decision  making levels of the partner cities  the previous 12 months of work culminated in presentations and discussion of our project work with the local  and national governments  sleman 17 6 2020  sam neua 23 6 2020  kratie 9 7 2020   who then  acknowledged the potential of polycentric management of their urban waters towards the sustainable  development of their cities  the cities approved the methodological approach of living labs as appropriate to  gain comprehensive k nowledge about water in their cities and develop strategic management approaches for  a transition towards water  sensitive cities  the profile of polyurbwater interventions in the cities have been  selected according to the following criteria a  relevan ce to project objectives  gain in scientific knowledge  and potential for development of methods and tools b  relevance to local needs  for such interventions  already voiced or demonstrated by residents municipality c  impact level of value added  provide d by the  project  d  minimization of risks for project implementation  e  institutional arrangements  established  stable open for collaboration f  capacities  manageable with available project resources g  manageability  by local structures and partners   considering the size complexity and heterogeneity of the three cities  decisions were taken to elaborate a customized comprehensive approach for kratie  and sam neua at the  overall city level and for sleman at a local district level  the local government  of sleman suggested six sub   districts as potential living labs  after comprehensive assessments based on the aforementioned criteria \n"
