 the research project within the frame of the bmbf sustainabl e development of urban  regions  nur  programme aims at contributing to a deeper under standing of risk related  urban sustainability  the overarching project goal it to establ ish a holistic comprehensive and  integrative multiple risks management of extreme events in fast growing  mega cities in  myanmar – with yangon as case study and transferability to four further large cities in myanmar   and potentially for southeast asia    during the preliminary and definition phases a transdisciplina ry project consortium was  established with partners from research government administra tion the private sector public  institutions and the civil society namely the university of co logne the fire department of the  city of cologne the flood protection centre of the municipal d rainage operation cologne and  the yangon city development committee as core partners further collaboration and  observation partners from germany and myanmar are contributing  major aims of the research  and development  r&d  phase of the project are  1  establishme nt of a metadata inventory  on existing databases for a holistic disaster risk management  2  contribution to an effective  institutional disaster risk reduction by strengthening institut ional preparedness and exchange   3  conceptualisation and evaluation of an effective inclusive  culturally adapted prevention  programme for the civil society in raising awareness on natura l disasters and personal  preparedness incl  against the loss of personal documents  4  conceptualization of a  prevention programme for the loss of the economic basis with a focus on system relevant  services such as private clinics food and water providers an d  5  conceptualisation of a  dialogue platform for innovative ideas for build back better st rategies in the covid 19  pandemic  the development of locally adapted multiple risk management con cepts to increase the  resilience of the local stakeholders are at the core of the pro ject  the transdisciplinary project  will conduct disaster risk reduction measurements with scientif ic monitoring and evaluation   with a mixed methods approach data surveys will be conducted t o conceptualise adapt and  evaluate appropriate awareness raising measurements  workshops and conferences will  serve as basis for strengthening the intra  and international i nstitutional exchange on the  project results  yangon and cologne  and during the implement ation phase also the other  large cities of myanmar  are expected to mutually benefit from the international exchange the  joint conceptualization and implementation of the concepts      11 multiple risks management in  mega urban regions  1 1 multiple risks – challenges for

partners steb cologne and afrb while 345 313 € are dedicated for national and international  subcontractors  692 734 € will be needed to cover the costs of the uoc and 207 609 € are  calculated as overhead  table 1 and 2   the foreign partners will not be able to contribute any funds  but they will contribute indirectly  and strongly with the provision of office space  already establ ished and functional in ycdc  and mei  and with the assignment of own staff during the entire funding period  their  contributions cannot be measured adequately in € and are thus n ot listed in the financial  overview   7 3 time frame for the implementation phase  24 months   currently it is unrealistic to present a time frame for the im plementation phase  as there will  be elections in myanmar on 8 11

awareness concept from the r&d project  phase shall be applied and conducted in at least eight further townships of yangon and its  regular refreshing will be implemented  the cities of nay pyi taw mandalay taunggyi and  mawlamyine which have been observing the project so far will be actively included into the  implementation phase  experts from these cities shall be traine d to adapt and implement the  concepts to their cities and townships  the auditing of importa nt buildings in yangon will be  established on basis of the guideline  the knowledge exchange on the use of the data inventory will be continued  the actors of the established city network will continue meet  regularly  at least two conferences will be held in yangon
