adaptive and sustainable urban development in central viet nam   floodadaptvn   summary of the project c entral viet nam is characterized by rapid urbanization particularly in small and medium  sized  coastal cities  at the same time the region is facing an increase in precipitation and heavy rainfall  events caused by climate change which combined with land use changes upstream results in  more frequent and more intense flooding  the overall aim of floodadaptvn is to   1  understand  and assess the drivers spatial patterns  incl  hotspots  and dynamics of present  day and future  flood risks  2030 2050 2100   2  investigate entry points for and barriers towards the  implementation of disaster risk reduction  drr  risk transfer  i e  insurance  and adaptation  solutions  with a strong focus on ecosystem  based approaches   3  co  develop a decision support  tool for risk  informed  spatial  planning and prioritizing among different drr risk transfer and  adaptation measures and  4  foster capacity development  focus area is the catchment of the  perfume river in the thua thien hue province viet nam which also includes the city of hue   drawing on a participatory transdisciplinary research design floodadaptvn builds on a st rong  network that was established in the preparation and definition phases   the network includes local  to national stakeholders and  inter national experts which deliver on the above mentioned aims and ensure their mainstreaming into relevant local national  e g  national adaptation plans  and  international policy processes  e g  the sendai framework for drr   during the definition phase  the modular floodadaptvn approach has been co  designed and pilot  tested successfully  a  sophisticated and transferable modelling framework adapted to local conditions will assessment  assess the present  day flood risks and possible future flood risk under representative  concentration  rcp  and shared socioeconomic pathways

impact reduction  protection targets social acceptance cost  benefit potential mal  adaptive consequences as well  as synergies and trade  offs with sustainable development goals  sdg  targets  the modular  approach will be made available in a designated flood information system  frame    to ensure that floodadaptvn produces policy  relevant outcomes strengthens existing and builds  new capacities in the region the key research questions the overall methodological approach as well as the type and format of the proposed outcomes and outputs will continue to be co  developed  and co  produced in close collaboration with relevant local stakeholders and vietnamese scientific  partners  this process has been initiated during the preparation phase and successfully continued  in the definition phase   1 description of the problem  1 1 regional challenges and the need for act ion  typhoons and associated floods repeatedly hit central viet nam predominantly in autumn  within  the last two decades catastrophic events took place in 1997 1998 1999 2007 2008 2009 2013 2016 and typhoon doksuri in 2017  in 2016 typhoon sarika and subsequent flood events left  134 people dead and missing  un 2016   in central viet nam 10  30% of the population was  affected about one million people were in urgent need for support and economic loss accounted for 460 million us$  in october 2019 and march 2020 extreme weather events resulted in four  fatalities over 5000 damaged buildings and infrastructures considerable loss of agri     aquacultural land and significant economic damage especially amongst small and mid  sized  enterprises in cities towns  as a result of climatic change it is likely that extreme weather events will further intensify in magnitude and frequency  ipcc 2014 monre 2016 bangalore et al   2019   coastal cities are particularly threatened by flooding – and with them the economic basis  and sustainability of their urban regions  kulp et al  2019   climate change and flooding will also intensify impacts on water quality or spreading pathogens through waterborne transmission with  knock  on effects on both natural and human systems  tran & shaw 2007 rui et al  2018   the  situation in central viet nam is characterized by rapid urbanization particularly in small and mid sized coastal cities  gso 2016  which leads to  1  increased surface sealing and associated inundations following heavy rainfall  2  loss of infiltration and retention areas generating higher  runoff and flood depth and  3  increased exposure through the expansion of settlements into  flood  prone areas  garschagen 2014 2015 sudmeier  rieux et al  2015 digregorio et al  2016    in central viet nam high urbanization trends co  occur with land use changes in the upper  catchment of the rivers  truong et al  2018 tamura et al  2020   the consequences are dramatic  as the coastal area is squeezed between the mountainous upstream area and the sea resulting  in very short response times when heavy rainfall occurs  due to changing settlement patterns housing typologies and lifestyles  from rural to urban  combined with societal transformation local  vulnerabilities as well as adaptation practices are also changing and have to be considered   garschagen & kraas 2011 pelling 2003 carew  reid 2008 bloch et al  2012   this dynamic and  forward  looking perspective is not only relevant for preventive adaptive planning but particularly  in a covid  19 context in which the virus and subsequent economic downturn have massive  implications for future vulnerability and adaptive capacity  local communities found ways to cope  with recurring flood events by the construction of dams  e  g  upstream of city of hue   flood  adapted housing and channels for water drainage  yet as demonstrated by the severe impacts  of past events and as emphasized by local stakeholders in the definition phase these efforts are  not sufficient to prevent disasters in the future  instead the development of new industrial and  residential areas is still given priority by local decision  makers intending to boost the economy  while little incentives for risk  informed planning are provided  garschagen 2016   addi tionally in  the city of hue which is the old capital and home to several of viet nam most treasured national  heritage sites flood damages to these buildings and places are of concern that directly relates to sense of place culture and income from tou rism  considering these challenges floodadaptvn co  designed objectives  section 2  and a w ork plan   section 3 1  which aims to better  1  understand and assess the drivers spatial patterns  incl   hotspots  and dynamics of present  day and future  2030 2050 2100  flood risks  2  investigate  entry points for and barriers towards the implementation of drr risk transfer and adaptation  solutions  with a strong focus on ecosystem  based approaches   3  co  develop a  spatial   decision support tool for risk  informed planning and prioritizing among different drr risk transfer  and adaptation measures and  4  foster capacity development   1 2 state of scientific and technological development  first the city of hue and its hinterland have seen a number of initiatives focusing on flood risk  reduction  e g  ihmen & ncap 2008 nam & udo 2011 razafindrabe et al  2014  with varying  scope extent effectiveness and sustainability   an integrated assessment of current and future  flood risks however is still lacking  floodadaptvn will engage with these initiatives to take stock  and make use of existing data   second flood conditions in the study region are specific  driven by an interplay of a  mountainous upper catchment short steep river s  and densely populated ar eas at the coast  for  the mapping and modelling of hydrologic conditions flood events and scenarios hydrologic and  two dimensional  2d  hydraulic models are widely used tools  for applications on larger scales  raster  based hydraulic models have proven t o deliver realistic results  tyrna et al  2017    third remote sensing provides information on flood extents land  use changes and trends   existing ecosystems imperviousness as well as urban structures and buildings types hence  supporting flood modelli ng and exposure assessments  bachofer & rau 2016 bachofer 2017  palacios  lopez et al  2019    fourth to fully grasp the complexity of risk assessments should capture the diversity of impacts  hazards might produce and their associated vulnerabilities – an approach described as multi  risk   garcia  aristizabal et al  2015  or multi  vulnerability  gallina et al  2016  in the literature  however  to date flood risk assessments mostly assess generic flood risk for a specific territory instead of  employing an im pact specific perspective where impact  specific drivers of vulnerability are  considered   fifth risk assessments in the context of climate change and associated hazards are often limited  to future hazard scenarios  e g  carew  reid 2008   future dynamics o f exposure and vulnerability  are mostly not adequately accounted for  garschagen & kraas 2010 birkmann et al  2015   this  presents a key gap given the dynamic societal transformation urbanization and economic  transition processes in central viet nam and the need for future risk scenarios as baselines for  preventive adaptive planning  garschagen 2015 sudmeier  rieux et al  2015    sixth existing drr and adaptation strategies still focus largely on structural  i e  engineering   based  solutions such as dams dykes reservoirs etc  while the consideration of ecosystem   based or hybrid approaches is a comparably new dynamically evolving field  estrella &  saalismaa 2013  hagenlocher et al  2018    unlike structural measures ecosystem  based  et al  2016  and provide additional co  benefits such as esthetic value food provisi on or water  purification  almeida et al  2018   a global review of ecosystem  based adaptation  eba  solutions  in flood  prone urban catchments conducted in the definition phase revealed that few studies have  evaluated the performance of eba measures and t hat criteria for the evaluation and monitoring  of the multiple benefits of eba measures are still lacking  further especially in small river  catchments lack of space in upstream as well as in urban areas and conflicting policy goals   e g  urban developm ent  does not offer easy solutions for ecosystem  based flood risk  reduction  ecodrr  and adaptation  eba     seventh in the context of flood risk management adaptive planning and sustainable urban  development a wide range of stakeholders needs to be inv olved and in countries like viet nam  the political economy of urban risk  garschagen 2014 2015 digregorio et al  2016  and the  contested ways in which resilience  building in urban regions is interpreted and institutionally  implemented by party  state ac tors  garschagen 2013 2016  need to be considered   eighth responding to climate  related risks involves decision making under uncertainty  ipcc  2014   this calls for future risk scenarios and decision support systems  dss  currently not  existing in urban regions of central viet nam  hertel & rosch 2010 nay et al  2014   there is  therefore a need to promote integrative decision  making tools as proposed by floodadaptvn   aznar  siguan & bresch 2019 bresch & mueller 2016 souvignet et al  2016    ninth climate risk insurance offers ways to transfer risks and reduce the impacts of hazards  on the most vulnerable  paudel 2012   several attempts have been made to introduce flood  insurance in viet nam  gfdrr 2016 hellmuth et al  2009   to date it is one of the few countries  having introduced climate risk insurance as a national commitment to the paris agreement  kreft  et al  2017   however existing efforts are concentrated on flood risks for agriculture while total  climate risk insurance coverage remains at onl y 5%  world bank 2017    building on the complementary expertise of the partners  chapter 4 1  floodadaptvn will address  these gaps in the r&d p hase  in contrast to other ongoing initiatives in viet nam floodadaptvn  has a distinctive focus on mid  sized ci ties on assessing current multi  risk and simulating future  risk scenarios as well as and on evaluating the potentials of risk transfer eco  drr and eba as  part of an overall drr and adaptation strategy   1 3 own previous work  the floodadaptvn consortium is well experienced and

implemented in the last  decade  table 1   the complimentary experience of the consortium  chapter 4 1  enables  tackling the above  mentioned challenges while its broad network has allowed establishing trust   based relationships with relevant decision  makers universities and practitioner s on local to  national level in the preparation and definition phases already  which is a key

above stated gaps in the rapidly urbanizing  flood  prone regions of central viet nam to assist local authorities in the developm ent of adequate  drr risk transfer and adaptation responses  to this end floodadaptvn will assess current  patterns impacts and future scenarios of flood risk the potential of risk transfer and of ecosystem   based and hybrid drr and adaptation options as c omplementary solutions to conventional  mostly structural measures   to ensure that floodadaptvn produces actionable and policy  relevant outcomes and enables  strengthening of existing and the development of new capacities floodadaptvn builds on a  partici patory transdisciplinary co development design between vietnamese and german  partners  following the consultative process of the co  design approach in the definition phase   seven interrelated work packages  wps  figure 1  were defined  in which we plan to co   develop apply validate and implement the floodadaptvn approach together with all project  partners and stakeholders  current flood risks and their associated impacts will be assessed  including an investigation of the impact  specific root causes driver s of flood risk  satellite imagery  analysis geospatial analysis and modelling will be used to map past and current flood events and  to assess the exposure and vulnerability of assets systems and sectors towards these floods   to enable preventive adaptiv e planning future flood risk scenarios  2030 2050 and 2100   will  be simulated under environmental climatic and societal change  here we will benefit from our  preparatory work in the definition phase for example by integrating data of installed climate  stations or by applying simulation prototypes at larger regions and in greater detail   existing and planned flood risk reduction risk transfer and adaptation solutions will be  identified  this involves strategies and measures at national regional  catchment and city scale  and will serve as a starting point for more detailed analyses at the neighbourhood and household  level  thereby a particular focus will be placed on risk transfer hybrid and ecosystem  based  solutions as part of an overall drr and adaptation strategy   findings from above activities will contribute to the identification of additional drr risk transfer  and adaptation measures demands and solutions as well as their evaluation against a set of  criteria  e g  protection targets stakeholders’ preferences cost  benefit ratios social acceptance  possible mal  adaptive consequences  co  developed with

utilization  due to the interplay of climate change and urbanization a better understanding of the drivers  hotspots and dynamics of flood risk in urban regions and the evaluation of the potentials of  ecodrr eba and innovative risk transfer options are of increasing global relevance  addressing  these challenges floodadaptvn provides extensive opportunities for economic and scientific  utilization of its results as well as for mainstreaming them into local national  e g  naps  and  international policy processes   for the project economic partners floodadaptvn offers economic exploitation opportunities in  particular for the modelling techniques and the frame system which are developed for the local  context  these tools offer a potential for knowledge transfer to other cities or regions  in particular  geomer will have the opportunity to further develop and test the hydrologic and hydraulic model  components in order to create a demonstration product for se  asian applicat ions while at the  same time developing a potentially new market in viet nam over the longer term  due to the fact  that the city of hue is trying to develop it industry it is planned to search for local cooperation  partners and target the market in joint venture activities either concerning the it  tools or consulting  activities  a contact to german representations such as the german chamber of commerce  abroad  ahk  is envisaged  as university and non  profit research institutions and think tanks the  unu t ue lmu izes and dlr do not strive for direct economic exploitation  insights and  developed products  eca  vn frame  are generally made available   5 2 scientific prospects  the scientific and technical chances of success as well as the innovation potential are considered  very high  the project addresses existing and pressing knowledge gaps regarding the  identification and adaptation approaches towards flood risks in urban regions of central viet nam  which upscaling potential to neighbouring provinces but also in other similar urban and coastal  areas worldwide  the methods and activities draw upon an extens ive local expertise from both  network coordinators and german project partners  particularly innovative aspects include  1  an  impact  chain based approach to assessing multi  risk reflecting local and regional complexities  2   development and simulation of future risk scenarios based on locally  adapted rcps and ssps   2030 2050 2100  with and without adaptation  3  the identification and evaluation of a portfolio  of adaptation options including eba and risk transfer  based approaches  the research results will  be outlined and discussed within the context of regional networking events and scientific events   a strong stakeholder involvement via co  design and capacity development ensures collaborative  learning and knowledge transfer and increases the legitimacy and policy  relevance of envisaged  outcomes for implementation in the next phase  a policy brief will document the modular  floodadaptvn approach  in addition a series of high  level publications to international journals is  envisaged along with broader dissemination to larger international audiences and the private  sector   5 3 potential for scientific and commercial follow  up and utilization  the scientific and commercial follow  up and utilization potentials of floodadaptvn are manifold   first a high  level scientific audience  comprising international and local experts in viet nam will  be created  joint high  level publications  peer  reviewed  and conferences  e g  aag egu  will  set the base for long  term collaboration capacity development and knowledge transfer towards  sustainable and adaptive flood risk management in urban regions  due to the very high innovation  potential there is a high chance that the approaches developed in floodadaptvn will be picked  up by other research institutes  research results co  designed developed with local authorities are shared via the frame platform and facilitated through the dissemination strategy outlined in the  work plan  the chances for an extensive dissemination and further development of  approaches methods and decision support tools developed in floodadaptvn in germany  viet nam but also internationally are therefore very high  second the strong commitment of  relevant stakeholders will enable the mainstreaming of floodadaptvn outputs into regional  and national planning  e g  naps   new stakeholders for instance from other provinces can be  included in the subsequent implementation phase   third the chances that the results of  floodadaptvn attract a broader audience from international financing institutions and the  private sector are very high  the strong scientific base of floodadaptvn and its natural  relationship with the private sector  e g  insurance soluti ons modelling services flood risk maps  production  offer a solid ground for the creation of a spin  off in collaboration with the academic  project partners  such a research spin  off would work in close collaboration with german partners  from the private sector in order to provide tailor  made solutions to local and national stakeholders  in viet nam and other urban regions facing similar challenges worldwide  the development of an  enabling strategy for these potential implementation partners is a key part of wp7  drawing on  the strategic position of unu at the science  policy interface the findings of floodadaptvn will be  mainstreamed into ongoing international policy processes and agendas such as the sendai  framework for drr  the sdgs  notably sdg 6 11 13   the nua and the paris agreement   further the results of floodadaptvn will be directly channelled into existing education and  capacity development programmes of partners both in viet nam and germany  furthermore  the capacity development formats tested during the r&d phase  e g  e  learning  are designed to  be transferable to other provinces in the implementation phase to enable the next generation of  risk scientists practitioners and decision  makers  lastly floodadaptvn findings and outputs will  be di sseminated to the wider public using the wide array of communication channels available to  the consortium including the project website and flyer the websites of the consortium

addition an application for  funding on the vietnamese side  huis  has been submitted to nafosted  national foundation  for science and technology development  in parallel to this application  envisaged start is spring  2021 duration 2 years   husc plans to apply for co  funding in 2021   a potential 2  year implementation phase strongly depends on the success and uptake of the  developed methodology   approach by local stakeholders as well as upscaling measures on other  provinces  the personnel budget estimation is therefore a forward projection of the current partner  structure to be able to accompany and supervise the implementation activities closely  with t  7 5  we facilitate the transfer towards the implementation phase  by c onsidering the demands and  needs of local stakeholders and the local business environment   t 7 6 assesses and prepares  also the upscaling of the project results methodology and technical implementation  five  implementation paths have been
