working package ‘urban  rural material cycles’  wp3   aims at understanding and supporting the management of mater ial flows in the context of spatial  human  environmental interactions agricultural production and urban  rural linkages  for urll #1 wp3  will focus on circular agriculture innovations as a motor for green urban  rural integration   based  on i  three material and nutrient flow
