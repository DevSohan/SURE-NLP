 the project greencitylabhu ế aims to s trengthen the climate resilience of the city of hue  thua  thien hue province central vietnam   through nature  based solutions  nbs  with a focus on  heat adaptation and air quality improvement   it will create a multidisciplinary research and  experimental space to develop test visuali se discuss and implement ideas and concepts on the  restoration and expansion of green  blue infrastructure  gbi   and thus for the promotion and  implementation of nbs  in the urban area of hue  in cooperation with stakeholders from science  politics  administration and civil society the international project consortium of independent  institute for environmental issues  ufu   humboldt  universität zu berlin   hub  mientrung  institute for scientific research  misr   thua thien hue institute for development studies   hueids   and the faculty of architecture of the university of sciences  hue university   husc  will generate joint knowledge for stakeholders and decision  makers on nbs resulting in  a city wide vision – a strategy contain ing guiding principles and best  practice recommendations  for a greener  more resilient  and sustainable urban development of hue  including proposals for  specific measures of gbi implementation    by providing information and scenarios based on qualitative research multilayer gis modelling  impact assessment  and the urban learning lab  ull  approach via the green city lab hue   gclh   and the project website  the project will inspire stakeholders  and decision  makers in  hue and other vietnamese cities to mainstream gbi development into their urban planning  processes  thereby k nowledge transfer  and p articipation of stakeholders and the public in  scenario development and planning process es will create co learning opportunities and build up  capacities for co  creation among administration  science  and the public    during its definition phase the greencitylabhuế project compiled a typology on gbi elements  and based on this first narratives and scenarios for gbi development in hue  and conducted  initial research on the current situation and preconditions for future developments of gbi in hue   which were summarised in the project status quo report  the generated knowledge resulted in  advancements and adaption s of the project design for the research and development   r&d   phase in particular the specification of the project focus towards heat adaptation and air quality  improvement  the inclusion of practical showcases  and the involvement of additional vietnamese  partner s  the r&d  phase will prioriti se the revision of land use change models carry out an  impact assessment implement participatory co design and co  learning process es combined with  practical nbs showcases and develop the green city vision hue for future gbi development  in the city   the integration of nbs and gbi into hue urban development will protect a wide range  of ecosystem services while strengthening the city social and ecological resilience to the  increasing effects of climate change  with its co creation and co  learning a pproaches  the project  will serve as a blueprint for inclusive and participatory urban planning  that will inspire vietnamese  urban areas are both drivers of global warming and especially affected by its impacts  in this  context  nbs and as such the enhancement and expansion of gbi are gaining importance in  strategic urban planning as measures for climate adaptation and mitigation   additionally access  to gbi is linked to issues of well being  environmental justice and human health    vietnam is one of the most densely populated countries in the world   308 person  km²  with a  population of 97 million living in an area of only 331221 km ²  strong demographic growth leads  to rapid urbanisation with a rate of 35 9% per year  the urban population accounts for 35% across  the nation which will grow to a share of 50% by 2045  the world bank 2020   with an urban  populatio n of about 52 million already by 2025  anh et al  2013    moreover vietnam is one of the  ten countries hit hardest by climate change impacts  eckstein et al  201 7  and is increasingly  contribut ing to global warming by rising greenhouse gas emissi ons  due to its exposed  geographical location especially central vietnam where hue is located suffers regularly from  extreme heat waves storms and heavy rainfall events  undp 2008   the outcome of such  extreme weather events are often infrastructure damage s and casualties  dang et al  2016   hue  is one of the oldest urban areas in vietnam  the city encompasses an area of about 71 km² and  is one of the most densely populated vietnamese cities with 5076 person km²  a first assessment  of climate change impacts in hue prepared for the definition phase indicates future warmer  weather conditions and an increasing total annual precipitation  these estimated impacts will  likely exacerbate existing environmental challenges in hue including incre asing heat stress and  flooding  other pressing environmental challenges especially in the densely built city centre and  university area are air and noise pollution   in hue green space per capita is comparatively high  with about 12 9 m² person   however  according to the results of the definition phase green  and blue  spaces are not equally distributed  across the city – with access to qualitative green areas being particularly limited in the historical  city centre – increasing the need for new gbi imple mentation   the further enhancement and  expansion of hue gbi has the potential to mitigate the aforementioned environmental  challenges by improving the provisioning of ecosystem services  in its infancy t his has also been  considered by the city administration in recent urban expansion planning  as hue experiences  trends of repopulation and urban growth that result in a high demand for additional living space  and thus in the construction of new suburban residential areas  policies indicate that th ese newly  developed areas should have higher green space ratios compared to the current state for  improving the overall proportion of green spaces in the city of hue  rösler et al   2020    further  results of the definition phase indicated the need to better preserve maintain and improve  existing elements of gbi  for reaching this  the city administration already implement ed first  smaller measures  e g  an initiative for the maintenance o f the street tree density through annual  of flooding while projects dealing with urban heat stress and air pollution are rare  and have not  received much attention  furthermore local financing mechanisms for environmental projects are  limited   a greener and more sustainable city contributes not only to health and well  being of its  inhabitants but also to the cityscape and tourist attractiv eness   however the economic and  societal benefits of gbi need to be targeted including the positioning of hue as a  eco   tourism  destination the creation of job opportunities the establishment of competitive advantages over  other vietnamese cities the impro vement of living standards through the creation of more  qualitative public spaces and the increase of public awareness towards the benefits of gbi   according to the vietnamese government status hue is categorised as a top priority city  its  prominent position as official grade 1 city within the vietnamese government city rating system  and its outstanding historic and educational importance give hue the status of a role model for  the more than 65 other provincial capital cities  prime mini ster 2005    the combination of its high  exposure to climate change impacts its national reputation as the city of culture and education   with many young and interested students and committed citizens  and its touristic importance  make hue an ideal location for the establishment of an ull for suitable innovative and  participatory concepts of gbi development for strengthening urban climate change mitigation and  adaptation  the gclh supports hue path t owards a greener and more sustainable future and  at the same time develop s an alternative model to high  density cities like hanoi and ho chi minh  city   3 state of the art of science and technology and results of the definition phase  typology on gbi elements  there is a host of reflections on gbi  langemeyer and gómez   baggethun 2018 haase 2015  breuste et al  2013   and several typologies o f gbi and nbs have  been developed e g  by green s urge  cvejic et al  2015   or nature4cities  nature4cities  2018    the gbi typology for the greencitylabhuế project is based on this mostly europe  centred  research but was subsequently co  created during the definition phase  i e  reviewed revised  and extended involving vietnamese partners based on their expertise and in consultation with  local architects and urban planners to obtain a common understandin g  whilst most of the key  elements are common in both  central  vietnam and europe some types were identified that are  unique to hue including green  blue gardens garden cafés  and garden houses  in addition  few  land uses e g  cemeteries commonly con sidered as gbi in europe were found to be of lower  importance to local stakeholders  moreover based on existing case studies  radic et al  2019  kowarik et al  2016  langemeyer et al  2015  and project findings  eisenberg et al  2019   the  devised typolog y was amended with impact indicators in the form of a qualitative ranking schema  of assumed impacts on seven selected ecosystem services evapotranspiration shading water  of narratives and

descriptions with quantitative methods  mallampalli et  al   2016  review a host of suitable methods for simulating land  use changes including system  dynamics fuzzy cognitive maps agent  based modelling cellular automata and gis bayesian  networks  etc   in the definition phase first narratives were formulated for an initial set of four scenarios based  on stakeholder interviews and the review of relevant local plans and policies   see table 1    the  scenarios follow a gradient of increasing degree of intervention from the status quo to a biophilic  city and foresee an increasing i mplementation of gbi elements within existing land  uses  as well  as the co creation of novel biophilic land uses  e g  woody public green spaces   the interventions  will be based on co  selected ele ments of the gbi typology deemed favo urable for local conditions  in hue to promote public acceptance  second to provide a basis for the actual simulation of land   use changes land  use data provided by the vietnamese partners was processed including spatial  alignment reclassification grouping quality control the creation of a draft inventory of green a nd  blue spaces and the definition of spatial intervention zones i e  citadel inner city and outer  city  for each narrative and under consideration of the aforementioned spatial zones transition  rules were defined accordingly in the form of a l and use change matrix and including quantitative  estimates of change rates based on local conditions and policy objectives  third for a set of four  test sites land  use changes were simulated according to the defined transition rules using a gis   based app roach  the test sites include one site within the citadel one inner  city site and two  sites in the outer city  fourth a n assessment of impacts of the simulated land  use changes on  selected ecosystem services has been carried out based on the gbi typolog y impact estimation   as the impacts are based on a qualitative ranking a procedure with references to weighted  summation multi  criteria analysis has been implemented for an area  weighted  pseudo   quantitative  impact estimation   city growth and expansion result in continuous encroachment  into natural and agricultural land that is converted into built  up  land and few urban green spaces  no measures will be taken  within the existing infrastructures  city growth and expansion result in continuous encroachment  into natural and agricultural land  however to im prove the  sojourn quality and as aesthetical intervention trees are being  planted in the newly built  up areas  still only few green spaces  are created  within the inner city and the citadel additional trees  are planted to improve air quality   scenario c – lager  scale improvements scenario d – biophilic city  encroachment into natural areas will be limited  instead most  of the expansion of hue is accommodated by agricultural areas   the new built  up land will be greened and existing  infrastructures will be improved by additional trees  intensive  extensive green ing green verges retention basins  or  rain gardens  woody public green spaces will be created within  newly constructed areas  existing green spaces will be  enhanced by playgrounds  natural areas will be protected and forest areas will be  increased by afforestation  agricultural areas and undeveloped  land might be built  newly constructed buildings and areas  enable the greening of roofs and facades and the high share of  woody public green areas  existing infrastructures will be  improved by additional trees intensive  extensive greening  green verges retention basins  rain gardens or bioswales   public green spaces will be enhanced by additional trees   woody elements and playgrounds   for a more detailed assessment at city  level especially for microclimatic impacts  temperature  regulation  and air quality  in the r&d  phase research on the impacts of gbi elements under local  climatic conditions will be furthered  and findings from the literature review incorporated  accordingly   for a more specific assessment of the impacts of various gbi elements at site  level  envi  met will be used in the r&d  project  cf  t1 2    envi  met poses a computational fluid  dynamics  based numerical simulator fo r the three  dimensional assessment of microclimatic and  bioclimatic conditions under consideration of surface plant and air interaction  rui et al  2019    it  is frequently used for simulating spatial and temporal profiles of temperature wind velocity  relative humidity and thereby thermal comfort  envi  met is also used for the assessment of  pm10 concentrations and thus can be employed for the evaluation o f impacts of nbs  interventions on air quality  ibid     envi  met has been used in a multitude of case studies with a  focus on europe and asia  particularly china  tsoka et al  2018     analysis of the policy framework for nbs in hue  the preliminary analysis of the policy  framework including legal documents and plans regarding nbs in hue showed that reference  points for nbs and gbi could only be found indirectly  a comprehensive integration and  mainstreaming of approaches of nbs into the p olicy framework remains a task for future project  phase s  moreover climate change adaption and mitigation need to be further embedd ed at the  local level  overall the planned development in hue offers numerous possibilities to integrate  nbs  additionally  there is the political backing by the current leaders – the chairman of thua  thien hue provincial people committee mr  phan ngoc tho and the mayor of hue hoang hai  minh – both being supporters of environmental and climate protection   stakeholder analysis for nbs in hue  a stakeholder analysis comprises steps to systematically  analysing interests and capacities of different stakeholders so that they can be considered when  developing and or implementing policies or program mes  hemmati 2020 schmeer 1999    the  development of nbs is a crosscutting issue that requires a multidisciplinary and multi  stakeholder  implementation of nbs were identified  however key actors and their precise relations with each  other need to be tested in practice and adapted accordingly  nevertheless already the initial  stakeholder analysis revea led the large number of stakeholder s and their diverse backgrounds  making an effective collaboration on nbs and gbi a challenging task   in addition  the knowledge  transfer between science on the one hand public and administration on the other hand needs to  be strengthened  it was pointed out that the diverse stakeholders don’t have a common  understanding of nbs and their knowledge and awareness of en vironmental planning differ  largely or are generally lacking  additionally  the overall public awareness of climate change  varies  with local experts indicating limited states of awareness across the public  therefore more  targeted information and educati on on climate change are recommended especially as many  people in hue are affected by urban heat stress  and air and noise pollution  nevertheless f irst  approaches of multi  stakeholder cooperation in an environmental context could be identified  the  government is working with businesses and investors to upgrade the environmental quality  system and a s a result of the cooperation between the public administration and science  the app  hue g for provincial leaders to monitor spec ific environmental data like air quality and water levels  was developed    public participation in hue  stakeholder and citizen participation plays a crucial role in the  effective implementation of nbs and enables public interests to be considered while  strengthening a project through local knowledge  thereby increasing acceptance for the  implementation of measures  as the results of the definition phase indicate the level of public  participation in hue is rather low and often remains on the stage of providing information on  planned urban developments to the public without giving the opportunity of taking influence on  the planning   however there is a social need and responsibility to involve local communities to  generate  co  benefits and acceptance   therefore  in the r&d phase the project will continue in   depth research on how to best embed public participation processes into planning and policy  recommendations regarding nbs in a vietnamese context  thereby  the ull approach will be  used for the g clh  cf  wp3  to support targeted and participatory planning of nbs   4 objectives approaches pursued and indicators of project success  the project has the overall objective to contribute to the increase and strengthen ing of social and  ecological resilienc e in hue and its surrounding province by promoting nbs and gbi approaches   including the promotion of protecting and enhancing existing urban ecosystems and the services  they p rovide  as well as planning and implementing novel green spaces and gbi  thereby  the  project especially focuses on active participation and involvement of experiences and visions of  local stakeholders experts  and other knowledge holders such as citizens   pathways of future urban development and desired futures  e g  based on policy goals and  visions   to do so  the integration from the participatory co  design and co  learning process as well  as local knowledge is considered crucial for successful scenario implementation  a further  objective is the impact assessment of the modelled land  use changes and nbs  interventions on the supply of selected ecosystem service s  objective 2   for the  identification of benefits and potential co  benefits of proposed nbs int erventions   furthermore  impact assessment takes  changes of trends in  the demand for ecosystem services into account    in so doing  the project provides the basis for identifying best  practice measure s and developing  policy recommendations  the project aims at capacity building education  and the promotion  of co  learning opportunities and co  creation procedures of nbs interventions  objective  3  to engage and activate different interest groups to be aware of and participate in planning  processes in their city and neighbourhoods  this will connect urban residents with professionals  through public engagement with nbs to build awareness and ecological literacy  furthermore  the project seeks to inspire other vietnamese cities  objective 4  to integrate nbs approaches  and co  learning and co  creation processes into their agendas  in addition  the basis for a  subsequent implementation phase  objective 5   will be established  including a co created  and co  developed draft green city vision hue for an effective implementation of nbs in hue  a  detailed concept and project plan for the implementation phase   finally the main objective of the  r&d phase is the development of a city wide vision document including proposals for a  green and sustainable city in coordination with decision  makers practitioners and the  public  objective 6  to do both strengthen c limate resilience and improve  micro climatic  conditions and air quality and thus the quality of life in the urban region  thereby the project will  build on findings of the impact assessment of nbs interventions and t he best  practice measure s  proposed on policy recommendations for effective mainstreaming and implementation of nbs  on the evaluation of the pilot projects and feedback from the various stakeholders   to reach the abovementioned objectives the following approaches will be applied  through  multilayer gis  geographic information system  models and supporting  gis  based   modelling technologies different narrative  based scenarios  i e  proposed nbs interventions for  a greener and more sustainable city will be simulated at city  level  in order to provide more  specific findings on nbs interventions envi  met a three  dimensional model incorporating  computational fluid dynamics  will be deployed for scenario  based simulations at site  level  in  preparation for the envi  met simulations  on site measurements of the microclimatic conditions  will be carried out at the selected sites  in addition an eco assets accounting  in the form of an  impact assessment of the modelled land  use changes and nbs interventions on relevant  ecosystem services e g  temperature regulation or air purification will be carried out to evaluate  districts or for affected stakeholders   in the context of this project the urban learning lab  ull   approach will be used for the g clh  i  to motivate professionals and authorities to integrate gbi  into their agendas  ii  to promote best practices of nbs and gbi planning in official urban  planning procedures  iii  to encourage citizens to learn about and to participate in the planning  of nbs in their cities  iv  to develop specific proposals for measures of nbs implementation in  hue and  v  to develop a blueprint of the above mentioned co  creation and co  product ion  processes to inspire other cities in vietnam and to stimulate a spill  over effect  scenarios will be  used as a tool towards targeted planning of future nbs development and learning multiple ways  to go where  i  different nbs can be involved according to the local settings and resources   including analysis of barriers for the implementation   and  ii  different constellations of  stakeholders can be involved in setting outlining the targets  all applied approaches contribute to  the development of the co designed green city vision hue  cf  wp5  and a subsequent  implementation project   the successful implementation of the project can be evaluated based on the indicators in the  following table  table 2   table 2 indicators for the achievement of the project objectives    indicator

completion of the co designed green city vision hue for the implementation of nature  based  solutions in the city of hue   5 relevance of the project to the funding goals of bmbf  the project creates a space for the exchange of information data  and ideas on nbs in hue  between stakeholders from science politics administration  practitioner s and civil society  and  to experiment with different urban development scenarios  t his international and multidisciplinary  cooperation translates approaches and ideas of sustainable urban development into specific  options for action and makes possible changes visible for the wider public  this allows not only  the development of widely accepted realistic and thought  out activities to improve socio   ecologic al conditions  climate change mitigation  and resilience in greater hue  it also strengthen s  the described approach es to other decentrally governed  fast growing and climate change  prone  cities in vietnam   6 planned research activities and the work program of the r&d  phase  wp1 modelling the implementation of land  use changes and nature  based solutions  lead  hub    wp1 will provide the greencitylabhu ế project with a revised set of land  use and land  use change  scenarios based on results of the definition phase including  i  development of a co  created case  study typology that identifies relevant gbi elements in the context of hue  ii  creation of narratives  that capture visions on urban development of hue  iii  devising   pilot kind  land  use change rules  and interventions w ithin existing land  uses that formali se the aforementioned narratives and  iv   collection and systemi sation of relevant gis data  wp1 will heavily built on these findings in the  r&d phase   however  wp1 will also extend and revise the proposed nbs interventions and  scenarios following inputs of local stakeholders   this could also include the addition of novel data  e g  the 2030 urban plan of hue depending on timely availability   in the r&d phase two tasks will streamline scenario development as described below t1 1 will  focus at the city  level whereas t1 2 focuses at specific sites within the city to model nbs  interventions in more detail  to do so a co  design approach is deemed crucial to allow for a  proper consideration of local conditions e g  regarding zoning restrictions or building codes   therefore wp1 is firmly embedded within the participatory co  design and co  learning process   cf  wp3   the results obtained in wp1 will be fed into the impact assessment carried out in wp2   t1 1 land  use change modelling at city  level  using a multilayer gis model and supporting   gis based  modelling technologies t1 1 will provide a revised model of land  use changes and  nbs interventions within existing land  uses at city  level for the whole of hue  this mapping of  changes and interventions is based on the narratives developed in the definition phase of the  greencitylabhu ế project and the associated transfo rmation rules that will be applied to a dataset  of current land  uses prepared in the definition phase  the effects of drivers on local conditions  that were identified through interviews in the definition phase for example ongoing urbani sation  or population growth will furthermore be incorporated into the scenarios e g  by mean s of  regression of trends regarding population count or urban densities  the modelled interventions  build upon the gbi typology devised in the definition phase  and are modelled within sector   specific land  uses e g  residential land commercial and indus trial land or transportation land  uses and with those gbi elements being considered that are deemed most suitable per sectoral  land use  in this context the embedding of t1 1 with the co  design and co  learning process of  the gclh is crucial p reparatory scenarios at city  level  m1 1  will be fed into wp3 to incorporate  under different scenario conditions these models will subsequently enable the assessment of  city wide impacts  cf  wp2  inform policy making support urban planning and provide a further  basis for the co  design and co  learning process in form of

pm  15   t1 2 nature  based solutions modelling at site  level  t1 2 adapts the scenario modelling  performed in t1 1 at the level of co  selected sites and localities within hue  however by  increasing the spatial scale to the level of city blocks or individual building ensembles t1 2 will  be able to provide more specific models of nbs interventions thereby representing the  implementation of g bi elements in more detail  to do so we adopt envi  met a three   dimensional model incorporating computational fluid dynamics that is deemed particularly suitable  for the modelling of urban microclimates and urban atmospheric processes at site  scale  t1 2 will  implement these envi  met simulations for the selected sites  first status quo simulations of site   specific conditions will be prepared which requi res gathering site  specific data regarding built  up  geometries sealing surface textures vegetation properties  etc  analogous to the status quo  land use dataset used in t1 1  second to allow simulation of local conditions envi  met requires  calibration to local  subtropical  conditions  this calibration requires on  site measurements  including air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity that is to be carried  out or supervised by vietnamese project partners  third scena rio specific envi  met simulations  will be implemented  analogous to t1 1 these simulations incorporate nbs interventions based  on the previously developed narratives and the gbi typology  similar to t1 1 a feedback loop  through the co  design and co  learn ing process   cf  wp3  is also considered for t1 2  thereby  stakeholders and decision  makers are involved in the co  creation of the envi  met simulations   the findings of t1 2

the proposed interventions affect the types  and conditions of urban ecosystems and how these changes affect the quantity quality timing  and location of ecosystem service supply and its relation with ecosystem service demand  wp2  the provisioning of these services to account for ecosystem service supply  here  potential co   benefits for other socio  environmental challenges identified for hue e g  regarding flooding   water quality  or biodiversity  shall be identified  to account for ecosystem service demand the  benefits of nbs interventions will be attributed to affected stakeholders  similar to wp1 this  assessment is two  fold and conducted on the scale of the whole city of hue  cf  t2 1  as w ell as  on the level of the co  selected sites  cf  t2 2   a subsequent comparison of scenarios will then  provide the basis for identifying best practice measures and for developing policy  recommendations  cf  wp4    t2 1 assessment of impacts on ecosystem se rvices at city  level  t2 1 is based on t1 1 and  will assess impacts on ecosystem service supply and demand at city  level and within co  defined  larger areas of interest  such as the citadel central city as a whole as well as the urban periphery    it uses the mapped scenarios from t1 1 as input for an indicator  based gis  based estimation of  changes in ecosystem service supply at land  use level wherein specific values for ecosystem  service indicators e g  cooling performance or recreational area per capi ta will be applied for  the assessment  schwarz et al  2011    additionally findings from a competition on designing the  proposed interventions  cf  t3 5  will be incorporated  in the assessment a special focus is given  to those land  uses for which nbs interventions are foreseen  however co  identified land  uses of  interest may also be investigated more closely for example cemeteries have been identified in  the definition phase of the project as under  appreciated gbi elements for which awareness of  ecosystem service supply should be raised  the estimated changes in ecosystem service supply  are subsequently contrasted with ecosystem service demand to identify actual improvements  through nbs interventions as well as possible intervention gaps e g  by also employing spatial  hot spot cold spot analysis  based on the mapped scenarios differences in landscape metrics  will be evaluated to identify linkages of the proposed nbs interventions with biodiversity and  habitat provisioning and to support urban gr een planning  walz 2011 seto and fragkias 2005

inform  potential revisions and the finalisation of the impact assessment at site  level  moreover and  similar to t2 1 findings from a competition on designing nbs interventions  cf  t3 5  will be  incorporated in the assessment  due to the spatial scale of task 2 2 this task will be able to  model changes in ecosystem service supply in more detail when compared to t2 1  interim results  of t2 2

open exchange  and learning on  nbs and gbi in hue  the ull approach is based on a systemic transformation methodology to  offer local stakeholders research  based expertise and to actively involve them with their local and  specialist knowledge in urban planning processes  this ensures that knowledge is excha nged  and not only transferred in one direction and that co  creation and co  production of urban  development measures are made possible  van der jagt et al  216   the ull approach also  enables and promotes the exchange of experience and knowledge between vi etnamese cities   the gclh will serve as a source of information and point of contact for nbs in hue  it is geared  towards the interested public and stakeholders in the field of nbs and gbi  decision  makers  business practitioners scientists students etc    its programme will include participatory events  with citizens and relevant stakeholders  policy round tables with decision  makers a regularly  updated
