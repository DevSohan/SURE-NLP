 during the build4people definition phase we were able to gain a deeper understanding of t he ca mbodian context and local characteristics that concern the research field of the build4people project and the specific research questions according to    the resear ch st ays the comprehensive exchange with our local researc h partners and other stakeholder s in  form of conferences and workshops as well as many internal project discussions specified our research approach  furthermore our interviews  as a preparation for our survey  and t he firs t pre  test of the survey gave manifold insights into the contextual factors t he envi ronmental conditions as well as perceptions and experiences of citizens of phnom penh  so far we have observed a rather limited local knowledge on the mindset of the ur ban popul ation from an environmen tal psychology perspective  an important insight for us according to the environmental awareness of people in phnom penh was the difference between local and global environmental issues  many localenvironmental problems such as air pollution and the lack of waste management were oft en re ported  local organizations and institutions already show some measures to meet t hose envi ronmental problems e g  by aiming at the promotion of the avoidance of plastic of l ess usage  of plastic bags of saving of drinking water enhanced waste management etc  corresponding posters and materials are observable in public spaces official institutions orrestaurants  during the project discussions and exchange with local actors however  the awareness and understanding of glo bal environmental problems such as climate change w as la cking  the connection of one own individual behaviour with global environmenta l pr oblems is usually not considered  this impression is in line with findings according to t he ga llup world poll indic ating that awareness of global climate change is higher in wealthier and higher educated countries  knight 2016   we reckon that this understanding should be addr essed by special intervention techniques focusing on knowledge transfer and t he re flection of observable social practices a nd their influence on the local and global environment  one possible way to approach this topic will be a collaborative wor kshop to gether with  # 5 on urban climate climate change consequences and climate change adaptation in cambodia  environmental concern and problem awareness can be defined as necessar y but not at all as sufficient preconditions of pro  environmental behaviour   see abr ahamse et al  2005   however an increase of problem awareness and salient social norms are important when developing interventions for behaviour change and campaigns in orde r to  prepare a basis for more sufficient strategies like strengthening social support or increasi ng sel f efficacy by concrete information about possible behaviour options  klöckner 2013  moreover  important insights that we could gain during the definition phase helped us to  develop a better understanding of different pro  environmental behaviours in phnom penh   we were aiming at a wide observation of the urban population in general and also on th e  urban middle and upper class with a rather high carbon footprint and unsustainable lifestyles  to a certain extent  after having conducted interviews and workshops during our first research stay the following environmentally relevant  private sphere  beh aviours were identified for the  daily life in phnom penh modes and means of transportation electricity consumption  with a special focus on air conditioning  waste management and the use of plastic  hence we were especially focusing on those behaviours in the survey and the planned intervention projects   since behaviour always needs to be regarded in its context we could also get a better understanding of the political and infrastructural factors that facilitate a certain behaviour or make it more diff icult  especially the interviews and workshops conducted by   on  sustainable urban transformation gave a comprehensive insight in relevant structural barriers for pro  environmental behaviour that shall be addressed by several urban transition strategies  and by a focus on individuals and their  sustainable  interaction with the urban environment   furthermore the concept of urban quality of life  uqol  could be set in the cambodian context during the definition phase by considering the local social struc tures and the urban  infrastructures  it is essential to put both the objective factors associated with urban quality  of life in the cambodian context as well as important social and cultural aspects that influence the subjective factors and the perception and evaluation of the city and its livability    within our interdisciplinary approach to the concept of urban quality of life we focus for example on the domain of walkability as a relevant determinant of uqol  walkability often came up during our collabo rative work and exchange with local actors as a relevant topic for  the perception of the city and the interaction between people and their urban environment  since pathways are also used for shops as parking spaces or are in no good condition walking is not easily possible for citizens in most of the city of phnom penh  urban green  spaces as a nother determinant of uqol are addressed within our approach and especially  elaborated by   urban green  focusing on the ir positive effects on phnom penh  citizens  our first insight during the definition phase show that there is a decrease of urban  green spaces in the way that the available green space per person decreases and less people have access to green spaces or are not able to reach them  the multifac eted functionalities  and options for use and the importance of urban green spaces on the uqol of phnom penh citizens are encouraging the dealing with this interdisciplinary topic during the research and development phase by both   and   and in join t working activities  according to the methodology that we apply within our research design important insights  were gained according to the application of the survey instrument  we considered cultural influences on the responding behaviour and could lear n from the experiences that our social  science local research partners reported on carrying out surveys in cambodia  we discussed  for example specificities about the khmer language intensively with our local partners  during  the preparation and translation process of our questionnaire it became clear that many words  used in our research field especially technical terms c ould not be translated unambiguously   those insights will help us to adapt the survey instrument and to develop further questionnaires   according to the experiences gained from the ecocity transition lab process that took place during the definition phase the impression arose that participation concepts are rather  unknown in the statutory urban planning practice and political context of cambodia   practiced participation does not seem to work in a comparable way to the processes we  might experience within our western cultural context  planning in urban cambodia is not  understood as a process but as a publication of planning documents which are already  outdated upon publication given the high development dynamics  correspondingly  architecture and urban planning does not seem to be much people  orientated but with a  focus on design  we will investigate cultural social and psychological facto rs in that regard  and we will thereby support   and   in their action research based activities and  participation processes during the research and development phase   the exchange and cooperation with our highly motivated cooperation partners at the rupp  provided us a clearer picture of the challenges associated with the development of a  curriculum of environmental psychology for the department of psychology at the rupp  first  of all the situation of psychology as a domain of science is different to the context of the  german universities  at rupp psychology can be attended as a bachelor degree but no  master program has been established  so far  t he education is more focused on practical  courses instead of research techniques and methods and there are no phd opportunities   the next issue date for a change of the bachelor curriculum is announced for the year 2023  within the research and development phase we are aiming to develop suitable seminar programs on environmental psychology topics such as human  environment interactions or  intervention techniques for behaviour change within the bachelor curriculum of psychology  furthermore by the help of our cooperation with   on urban climate we will develop a curriculum input to the master of climate change  the fruitful cooperation and open  communication with the local research partners are notably encouraging the joint curriculum planning within the research and development phase   the main aim of the research and development phase is to foster sustainable behaviours  and sustainable living for people in ph nom penh  this has to be realized in accordance with  the overall aim to enhance urban quality of life  uqol  for all citizens of phnom penh through  sustainable urban transformation

sphere and the reflection  refinement & re  integration of created knowledge sphere     3  state of the art  understanding explaining and changing human behaviour can be defined as the main  objectives of psychology  one goal of environmental psychology as a specific discipline is to  understand what determines people behaviour with regard to within the last 30 years  understanding and exp laining behaviour can be considered as the  initial condition to be able to find ways to change one behaviour towards an environmental ly  friendly behaviour  de young 1993   when aiming to change an environmental significant  behaviour it is crucial to un derstand the factors influencing this behaviour and the context of  the situation individuals face  stern 2011    in order to conceptualize environmental behaviour or sustainable behaviour we have to keep in mind that there is not a general environmental behaviour  behaviour always occurs under  specific circumstances e g  using the bicycle instead of the private car separating waste or saving energy at home  this is especially important when aiming at promoting pro   environmental behaviour focusing only on an individual general pro  environmental mindset   e g  general pro  environmental attitudes values etc   will not inevitably change a behaviour  significantly without addressing the barriers drivers and attitudes for the specific behavioural  contexts   the environmental psychologist paul stern suggested to differentiate various facets of pro   environmental behaviours in order to understand and promote these behaviours with respect  to their specific causal and contextual factors  stern 2000   these causal factors may vary  across these facets of behaviours and individuals hence each target behaviour has to be theorized and addressed suitably    researchers stress the importance of behavioural sciences  and psychology  for supporting  pro environmental behaviour and thereby tackling climate change  stern 2000 2005 2011    one other aspect of the specificity of behaviours is considered in this regard the importance of differentiating between intent   and impact  oriented strategies   there are some behaviours as sociated with a high environmental impact that might not be  defined as everyday behaviours e g  investment decisions  investing in energy  efficient  technologies such as a solar panel deciding to buy a „green building or to move to a  sustainable neighbo urhood   these behaviours underlie specific constraints and are  characterized by high impact  at the same time these behaviours are only significant for  groups of the population that have resources  in terms of socioeconomic status  to effort these decisions and investments  data from the german panel umweltbewusstseinsstudie indicate that income seems to be the most important predictor for carbon footprint  moser &  kleinhückelkotten 2017   new urban middle classes and their consumption styles are identified as a main driver of global environmental problems  wbgu 2016 s  152 myers &  kent 2003   and thus as relevant actors in transformation processes towards a more  sustainable society  consequently the so  called new consumers in phnom penh [income  groups between 401 and 1200 usd   national institute of statistics 2018 ] have to be defined  as an essential target group when it comes to questions of behaviour change  this target group is characterized by its high saving potential and high degree of freedom  based on  resources  in terms of investment decisions and behavio ur change  some studies in the  southeast asian context already consider those societal groups in their role of relevant actors  in the transformation process   anantharaman 2014 fernandes 2009      within the build4people project the concept of urban quality of lif e is a guiding component  of sustainable urban transformation  in accordance with this it makes sense to approach  urban quality of life in two ways an analytic research approach that asks for the relative impact of different objective and subjective factor s on urban quality of life and a more  normative approach that understands sustainable transformation as an essential prerequisite for urban quality of life especially with regard to the  comprehensive  sustainable development goals   the right to a certain quality of life has to be qualified with respect to solidarity in order to prevent the restriction of others – this is especially the case for high density urban areas  the  realization of a desired individual quality of life may happen at the expense of others  e g   gentrification or living in gated communities   at that point urban quality of life is not only an individual project  moreover uqol has to be considered as a social project and a process of negotiation  jaeger  erben & matthies 2018    fostering conditions that are considered through the concept of  resistance resources might  be one relevant goal in the domain of sustainability strategies  from the perspective of  environmental psychology psychological and social resistance resources play an important  role when it comes to the entire resilience1 of the eco  social system of urban spaces   resilience is directly associated to the concept of salutogenesis2 developed by aaron  antonovsky  1997   with respect to the concept of salutogenesis  figure x depicts a  framework that suggests the integration of different factors that affect urban quality of life  and reflects the interplay of subjective factors   people sphere  and objective factors  sphere  of environment       1 re silience refers to the capabilities and characteristics of a person as well as to those  environmental conditions that help the person to manage stress and stay well  these  generalized resistance resources  see figure 1  enable a person to make sense of coherence  and to manage situations  resistance can appear towards environmental stressors  such as noise pollution etc   and harmful experiences that citizens might have in the city  over time  the successful use of resources can become a tool for copin g with those stressors itself   education material resources social cohesion and individual capabilities belong to those resistance resources   in contrast generalized resistance deficits are described by stress and  a lack of these capabilities and reso urces   the figure depicts two spheres of the context of uqol the sphere of the human  people  and  the sphere of the environment that surrounds him her   the manifestation of uqol depends  on the balance between generalized resistance resources and resistance deficits  this balance  will determine whether a factor will decrease is neutral or increase urban quality of life  the  sphere of people includes human traits like capabilities needs and coping strategies   the  sphere of the environment includes the designed urban environment  buildings streets  urban  green infrastructures  public parks recreation areas  and urban governance structures   furthermore the impact of climate change will affect urban quality of life as well   factors like social cohesion  active participation  in the se nse of social inclusion and a sense  of belonging  can influence subjective quality of life by mediating the effects of environmental factors  thus environmental stressors like noise annoyance level of crime and pollution will  especially affect people with less psychological resilience in terms of higher levels of stress  illness und social withdrawal  taking these processes into account can enable hints for strategies to foster urban quality of life by considering the complex interplay of different  factors instead of addressing isolated symptoms  the increase of urban green infrastructures  will probably reduce environmental stress with respect to an increase of psychological resilience  wellbeing and urban quality of life  measures to strengthen social cohesion and  joint responsibility for those spaces should be addressed as well  thereby the framework can help to understand and explain phenomena like the so  called paradox of satisfaction   dien er & diener 1996 herschbach 2002  addressing an alleged contradiction between  objective  indicator based  measures of quality of life  environmental sphere  and the assessment of those environmental factors  people sphere   people may indicate quite high  levels of life satisfaction although objective indicators of their living conditions are harsh others might indicate low levels of wellbeing and satisfaction although objective indicators seem to be very supportive    this consideration is crucial to us since people who are s ocio  economically disadvantaged  are especially affected by physical factors  also such as impacts of climate change on the urban climate  that have an impact on quality of life and wellbeing  see marans 2012   because of a la ck of resources and a lower degree of freedom  they have less opportunities  to design their residential environments   as a consequence they will be more affected by  public resources like public urban green public recreation areas etc  data from kuo and  sullivan  2001  indicate that residents living in greener surroundings seem to have lower  levels of fear and show less aggressive and violent behaviours  low  income residents seem  to especially profit from the greener environments  taylor kuo and sulli van  2002  support  these findings  their data show a positive correlation of near  home nature and different forms  of self  discipline and capacity of direct attention for city  girls from low  income families  7 to  12 years old  in chicago  taking into accoun t possible culture  specific constraints these  results give a hint for the relevance of factors   like public green   that may impact urban  quality of life for low  income residents   another perspective that has to be taken into account is the aspect of gender  fadda  2003   suggests that the concept of uqol needs to be understood as a social construct which is in  relation with gender and the environment  in this context human beings perceive their surroundings acco rding to their social role  this might lead to quality of life also differing  between gender  a meta  analysis showed that women in general have a higher environmental  concern then men and participate more in environmentally friendly behavio ur  zelezny chu a & aldrich 2000   moreover a study showed that woman have a higher perceived  effectiveness when it comes to environmentally friendly behavio ur  vincente  molina  fernandez  sainz & izagirre  olaizola 2013    therefore a gender perspective also needs to b e  taken into account when examining environmental behaviour s   there exist many comparative studies that put environmental relevant psychological  constructs side by side by comparing the descriptive data between countries e g  according to pro  environmen tal behaviour  li 2015  environmental consciousness  sasaoka 2014  or  knowledge about the environment  vicente  molina fernández  sáinz & izagirre  olaizola  2013   moreover some studies examine how culturally dependent psychological factors influence t he relationship of cognitive emotional or behavioural processes  an example is the  assumption on the perception of control as an influencing factor on the degree of pro   environmental behaviour  kalamas cleveland & laroche 2014   the so  called environme ntal  locus of control differs between cultures and can thereby influence people choice of pro   environmental behaviours  other factor s that influences pro  environmental behaviour are  social and cultural norms that give people an idea of what is socially accepted and expected  in a cross  cultural study samples of germany and japan were interrogated according to their  normative beliefs and pro  environmental behaviours  ando ohnuma blöbaum matthies &  sugiura 2010   this study shows that social and societal norms play a major influencing role on pro  environmental behaviours in japan whereas the personal norms has a stronger  impact on p ro environmental behaviours in germany     4    research plan  within the build4people project urban quality of life is a guiding component of the project’ s  purpose aiming at sustainable urban transformation    will therefore coordinate the  measurement an d conceptualization of the quality of life of people living in phnom penh  we  are interested in understanding and supporting urban quality of life of people in phnom penh and strengthen the people  centered approach of the b uild4people  project  the investig ation  of the concept of urban quality of life  uqol  will be both a main research focus of  #1  as well as the connecting scientific  conceptional analytical and normative link between the  different disciplines within the b uild4people project     will focus on the interaction of people and the urban environment considering the assessment of objective factors as the climate the built environment and the socioeconomic  sphere based on the cooperation with       and    following a  transdisciplinary approach   will organize the process of conceptualizing the interplay  of the facets that determine people urban quality of life  the measurement of relevant objective factors will be organized and conducted in close cooperation with   according  to the application and development of a citizen science input app  see proposal of   for  further technical details      4 1 household survey  during the first phase  scientific and societal problem  based research  a household survey  will be conducted  realized as a standardized que stionnaire  with face to face interviews    combining subjective and objective factors in regard of uqol  a sample stratified with  respect to gender socioeconomic status and family status is asked for the evaluation of  different factors that are expected to have a significant impact on their qu ality of life   we do not aim at a demoscopic survey in order to describe the distribution of attitudes  this  would require a very large representative sample    we ask for systematic impacts on uqol  instead  the sample size is based on power analyses  see cohen 1988  taking into account  the number of relevant predictors statistical power and estimated low and middle effect size   assuming quite low statistical effects about r2= 05 about 18 predictors  e g  age gender  socioeconomic status education lo cation of housing about 6 physical factors 6  psychological factors  and a statistical power of about  9 a minimum sample size of n = 485  is needed in order to realize the testing of regression models  cohen 1988   therefore we  are planning to conduct 500 face to face interviews  the field work of the face  to face  interviews will be carried out by a market research institute   the variety of factors is determined by the state of the art from the field of environmental  psychology  e g  problem awareness ecological system versus socio  political and socio   economic system  local versus global issues  ascription of responsibility personal  internal   versus politics  external   norms values etc    and by results from a build4people resea rch  workshop scheduled at the end of the definition phase  november 2020  which is among others based on the results of a roundtable workshop at royal university of phnom penh in  march 2020  the survey will take into account both the sphere of people  su bjective factors   as well as the sphere of the environment  assessment of objective factors   within our  research we encounter the cultural context specificity with respect to a culturally sensitive  approach  therefore we take into account theoretical assumptions about cultural  dependencies and methodological paths that will meet those specificities     app   we aim at a joint data set of n =100 in order to realize parametric data analyses  this  input app allows for collecting storing and visualising objective a nd subjective data during  the mobile mapping activity in field   thereby  we will have a linked data  set from participants who took part in the face  to face  interviews and used the input app as well  for more detailed information concerning the  citizen science input app see p roposal of      in this research activity  we focus on  collecting information on the citizen subjective perception and assessment of the quality of  urban green spaces  in doing so it will be possible to link subjective data with objective data  from the field mapping [see also b4p milestone tr3  month 12  first results   analysis of  collected data from citizen science input app and from household survey]  at a later stage   such a citizen science approach s hall be extended to analy ze other aspects of urban quality  of life as well   as the research focus of the build4people project will shift to more transdisciplinary action  research approaches during the second and third year different participatory activities will  take place  organized and conducted by    in order to supplement the ongoing analyses  of the uqol dataset  these ac tivities will include a multi  stakeholder workshop with local  stakeholders and decis ion makers as well as focus groups that will dis cuss conflicts between  individual lifestyle claims and sustainability goals   furthermore the co ncept will be elaborated in iterative exchange with all wo rk packages of  the build4people project  all these activities will aim at a deeper and context  sensitive  understanding o f the concept of urban quality of life  the results from the data analyses and the participa tory activities will enrich other build4people processes like the ecocity transition  lab the sustainable building arena and the sustainable building business incubator   until now there is no evidence  based interdisciplinary model of urban quality of life   with  this model the build4people project can contribute to closing the gap in scientists’  disciplinary understanding of urban quality of life by providing data  based insights to  interaction effects and moderating effects of subjective and objective pred ictors of urban  quality of life that has to be understood as a component of sustainable transformation  therefore the uqol model will be finalized during the final build4people research phase of  reflection refinement & re  integration of knowledge  an it erative process of including more  objective data in collaboration with the other  s and the respective experiences  measurements and data gained from their work  moreover refining the weighting of different factors  based on results of the survey data an d the transdisciplinary action research  will  conclude with a final transdisc iplinary uqol model   beside the scientific dissemination of th is transdisciplinary model possible planning  strategies  that will be derived from the model  will be discussed with all wps local research  partners and stakeholders during in a technical session during the build4people outlook  conference [b4p milestone k3 month 46] in order to enhance urban quality of life in phnom  penh  these planning strategies will become part of the b4p toolbox  all these insights will  also flow into the development of build4people dissemination products such as the awareness campaign the poster and photo exhibitions and the handbook for green housing  and sustainable living   during the implementation phase   and   aim to further develop the citizen science  input app in order to enable the integrated measurement and calculation of urban qu ality of  life for specific districts based on the most relevant predictors  influencing factors   of the  uqol model   4 2 online survey new consumers  the new consumers in phnom penh represent an essential target group when it comes to  questions of behaviour change  see chapter 3   state of the art  because of its high energy  saving potential and high degree of freedom  based on resources  in terms of sustainable  investment decisions and behaviour change   a standardi zed questionnaire that will be app lied to this specific target group will reflect  culturally specific aspects the environmentally relevant mindset  e g  personal beliefs about  climate change problem awareness local versus global values norms and perceived behavio ur control  self  reported pro  environmental behaviour as well as relevant questions  from our colleagues from all b4p work packages  we aim to be sensitive to the aspect of  gender in our research as well   therefore we will consider gender specific behaviour  constraints and barriers for pro  environmental behaviours and include relevant questions in  this respect      the testing  questionnaires  will take place online as this target group will be able to use  computer smartphones to answe r these question s  n=150    the implementation and  conducting of the questionnaire will happen in cooperation with a market research institute    in addition to the standardizes questionnaire we will conduct focus groups addressing expected conflicts within individual demands concerning quality of life and social norms of  sustainable lifestyles in order to develop new perspectives based on participatory methods   both the results from the questionnaire as well as the results from the focus groups will  provide the basis for data   and theory  driven intervention techniques  some of these tailored  intervention techniques will be applied and pretested with a subsample of the new consumer  target group [see also b4p milestone ac2  month 38  imple menting a trial of a selected  intervention on behaviour change  specific target group in the case area regarded within the ectl process ]   the different intervention techniques will become part of the toolbox   the results of the online  survey and of the fo cus group will enrich the development of the  awareness campaign and will stimulate the different products of the other build4people  processes like the ecocity transition lab the sustainable building arena and the sustainable  building business incubator process     4 3 awareness campaign  thereby we hope to initiate promising paths and policy measures that support a sustainable  urban transformation and sustainable development in cambodia  in addition to the  governmental responsibility to take pro environmental actions and decisions the general  public shall also be actively engaged in this transformation process that we are aiming to  facilitate by the means of our project activities   according to the current state of research we consider socia l dynamics and social influence  as a crucial role when aiming at addressing the general public and behaviour change towards more sustainable lifestyles  griskevicius cialdini & goldstein 2008 kallgren reno & cialdini 2000   the build4people project will therefore aiming on developing campaigning  strategies that utilize social influences in forms of descriptive social norms  e g  as common actions actually exhibited in relevant peer  groups     as well as empowering the citizens to contribute to the transformation by choosing a certain  lifestyle and behaviours that are in line with sustainability goals   to realize a good fit of  measures and target groups we will realize participatory techniques in order to develop   based on the results of the household survey and focus groups  adequate campaigning  strategies  this participatory process will be part of the build4people eco city transition lab  process and part of multi  stakeholder workshops at the b4p conferences  this process is  intended to realize a toolbox of different adequate strategies for awareness campaigns   a trial of one specific measure for the target group of the new consumers is planned the specific outline has to be adjusted within the participator proce ss   as a dissemination mean of our project we strongly focus on the communication of our findings and our approach in order to raise awareness for sustainability issues and to equip the society with this knowledge in a wide scope  these general dissemination strategies will  be finely tuned with the communication of positive descriptive social norms  s o    in doing so dissemination products like the poster ex hibitions the handbook for green housing and  sustainable living and the build 4people photo exhibition  pioneers of sustainable lifestyles  in cambodia  can support the process of rising awareness and fostering a social norm

research activities  a 10% partial position is allocated here to perform the research in this project    within this time allocation she will support and lead the research associate and will perform tasks of the  and overall project organisation and research work   activities and milestones2021 2022 2023 2024 the implementation of the planned activities within   involves little or no risk  the  realization of the planned ac tivities is supported by the research and network structures that  have been established and consolidated during the definition phase   moreover the activities  are based on a jointly agreed research strategy that was discussed intensively and  coordinated at the beginning of the definition phase in a kick  off and coordination workshop  in germany and in a round table workshop in cambodia with the lo cal research partners  the  cooperation with the implementation partners is consolidated as a memorandum of  understanding was sig ned be the phnom penh city hall that specifies the joint activities for  the r&d phase and provides an outlook on the following implementation phase   the quality of the survey instrument  standardized questionnaire  for the joint empirical  research was already evaluat ed and adapted with regard to culture  specific factors  in order  to control these aspects the reliability of a preliminary survey  including item analysis  was  carried out in the definition phase   according to covid  19 the global situation and travel restrictions can affect the work stays  at the beginning of the r&d phase  the methodological approach allows an adaptation to the development of the pandemic  an alternative to conduct face  to face interviews could be  realized by an online survey  regarding the collaborative activities online meetings and  conferences can take place as it was also carried out during the definition phase  in this  respect the research strategy and collaboration should not be affected by covid  19     6  application potential and utilization potential  6 1 economic success prospects  for   there are no direct economic utilization or patent applications plan ned     focuses on the investigation of theoretical and data  based findings on determinants of  environmentally friendly behavio ur in the city of phnom penh  the aim is to develop effective  intervention techniques and practical strategies based on the findings of the definition phase  and the research and development phase  in the further course the developed measures will  be implemented as well as evaluated in the implementation phase  with the development of  such concepts we see our university making an important contribution to socially relevant challenges and issues     the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach initiates new research fields that can  make a significant contribution to disciplinary and interdisciplinary publication strategies   specialist journals conferences   from the perspective of environmental psychology little is known so far about culture  specific environmental relevant norms values attitudes and  barriers for environmental ly friendly behaviou r in the region of southeast asia  the project  offers the opportunity to analyze the role of established psychological constructs for pro   environmenta l behavio ur in this specific cultural context and to develop and evaluate adapted  modified intervention techniques  the results can widen the teaching in environmental  psychology at the university of magdeburg and can further be used to build up and perma nently establish environmental psychology as a teaching and research field in  psychology at the royal university of phnom penh  the project enables the promotion of  young researchers in germany through master theses dissertations and international  exchange as well as the promotion of young researchers in cambodia     6 3 scientific and economic connectivity  the main focus of our work package is on the scientific connectivity and compatibility  the  expected results of our empirical research can enrich the transdisciplinary understanding of  quality of life in an urban context in cambodia    integrates the dimensions of  environmental  behavio ur subjective perception and acceptance into the interdisciplinary  group targeting the theory  based interventio ns enhancing urban quality of life in  accordance to sustainable urban transformation  the expected findings on tailored  intervention techniques can help to promote pro  environmental behavio ur in phnom penh   with regard to economic connectivity we expect that our findings   through successful  behavio ural change   can contribute to reducing energy costs for the cambodian population   in addition a general increase in acceptance for green buildings and sustainable urban districts is expected     7    contrib utions to trans  disciplinarity  the build4people project main aim of enhancing the quality of life through sustainable urban  transformation will be pursued by the manifold expertise of the different wps’ disciplines  the scientific background of   on environmental psychology will strengthen the project  people  centered approach by considering the perception and evaluation of the urban  environment of phnom penh citizens and the human  environment interaction within the city  in the leading role of developing and conducting the uqol household survey and guiding the  uqol citizen science process and the uqol  model development   data modelling    will contribute to the trans  disciplinarity of the build4people project in multiple ways  the  perspective of the other disciplines will be integrated within the contextualization and  measurement of uqol as the theory  based assumptions reflect uqol to be determined by  the interplay of subjective factors  people sphere  and objective factors  sphere of  environ ment     will organize this trans  disciplinary process of measuring and modeling  the interplay of the facets that determine people urban quality of life   the b4p uqol citizen science process is a joint activity between the work packages      ur ban climate     urban green  and    overall project  coordination      will contribute to this process with the methodological expertise of empirical data collection and statistical analysis of individual perception and assessment of the urban envi ronment   furthermore   will support the trans  disciplinary action research activities of   and    within the ecocity transition lab process and the sustainable building arena process on different scales  by giving input from the perspective of env ironmental psychology and on  the main results of the surveys   will include empirical insights of the people   perspective on urban processes and determinants of a sustainable and livable city   the dissemination strategies of the build4people project c an be finely tuned with the theory   and data  based psychological perspective and recommendations for an effective  communication of positive descriptive social norms of sustainable lifestyles   8   preparation for implementation phase as   focuses on the human sphere within the sustainable urban transformation insights and explanations on environmental behaviours environmental concern and social norms ofsustainable lifestyles will allow the further implementation of context  adapted effecti ve in tervention techniques as a contribution to socially relevant challenges  the trial of one speci fic measure of an intervention for behaviour change for the target group of the new consumers will be monitored and evaluated in the r&d phase and will be further de veloped in  the implementation phase  behaviour change interventions shall then address differen t envi ronmental relevant behaviours and be implied to a bigger audience  the activities of the awareness campaign on uqol and sustainable living will lead to th e devel opment of a module within the build4people toolbox that will depict different adequat e st rategies for awareness campaigning and social marketing  this campaigning module shall facilitate the actual development of an awareness campaign on sustainable living within the implementation phase  as the general public shall be actively engaged in the sustainabletransformation process in phnom penh the insights and results of   activities and the  scientific and societal problem  based research will lead t o further participatory processes  within the project ongoing intervening  by the enablement of networking activities between stakeholders from state economy and civil society and an increased awareness about issues  of green buildings sustainable neighb ourhoods and sustainable lifestyles we are aiming at a  thorough and sustainable change that shall be strengthened during the implementation  phase   regarding   research activities related to the urban quality of life process and model development model  based planning strategies to foster urban quality of life in phnom penh  as part of build4people toolbox will be elaborated  the recommendation of those planning strategies and policy measures will be further established by the means of the project comprehensive activities and local cooperation   during the implementation phase we aim to further develop the citizen science input app in  order to enable the integrated measurement and calculation of urban quality of life for specific districts based on the most relevant predictors  influencing  factors of the uqol  model  it is envisaged that further uqol indicators will derive from the statistical model of   using the results of the household survey  a feasibility study to grasp uqol by means of the citiz en science input app is produced in the end of the citizen science process  this  report is the preparation for the build4people uqol citizen science app one of the envisaged products tools in the implementation phase  the main idea of this app is to allow  citizens to evaluate a set of specified uqol indicators  according to their ranking certain simple statics  median quartiles standard deviation variance coefficient of variation  standard error  are calculated  resulting a ranking of specific neighbou rhood takes place  the  further and more profound analysis and evaluation of the collected data could be achieved in  a web mapping software like mappin  hosted by lutra consulting limited  allowing the project team to display refined results as detailed ho tspots maps to a much wider audience   in addition mappin could be used to provide our results to several mapping portals for the  phnom penh authority  publishing monitoring recommendations of e g  critical urban green  areas due to a lacking public acces s and could also link into planning portal to show maps of  planning applications  see proposal of        9    rough work   and implementation plan of implementation phase  the detailed work plan of the implementation phase will be developed during the research  and development phase [see also b4p milestone ws4 build4people proposal writing  workshop hamburg  month 37  and

order to enhance urban quality  of life and to keep their environmental impact within the sustainable borders today and in future ?  sub  questions  ø how do people perceive the residential environment as supportive of quality of life ? what is the  influence of the occupant on building operation and which design and technical parameters  influence th eir behaviour and perception? how are su pportive and sustainable environments  built equipped and operated?  ø what are the domains of buildi ng that are relevant for sustainable development and urban  quality of life in cambodia today and in the future? wh ich dimensions of a sustainable building  must be addressed to achieve the quality of life and sustainable development at the same  time?  ø which technological fields need to be advanced as enablers for sustain able transformation   and how can such development be achieved in selected technology fields ? what are the steps  of a technology roadmap towards urban quality of life in buildings ?  ø how can indoor environmental quality be evaluated measured and enhanced both on the user  and building level in the specific context of phnom penh ? how can its different aspects be  improved? how can such evalu ation be applied for building design and policy development?   1  insights of the definition phase  during the definition phase work package 2     research focused on the understanding and  awareness of the basic concepts of sustainab ility in buildings in phnom penh so that a research plan  of the upcoming research and development phase  r&d phase  could be conceptualised   methods  of research during definition phase were the review of existing literature the discussions with  relevant stakeholders and building sector professionals during the two stays in phn om penh and a  first measuring campaign acting as a test  campaign of our procedures to identify possible problems  and help with develop ing and standardising a research protocol   this research protocol consisting of a building audit guide & questionnaire was developed in  collaboration with the camarsec project  bmbf client ii project in vietnam 7 2019  6 2022   the  whole procedure and equipment are planned to be aligned so results from both projects can be  analysed together  and synergies between the two projects and possible future collaborations are  enabled either in the next phase of the build4 people project or other related research in the area   joint or coordinated efforts between projects can achieve more significant impac t  they can lead in  future project proposals that build on each other or parallel projects that complement each other   from the discussions  it was evident that the awareness of sustainability issues in the building and  construction sector in c ambodia is generally low although gradually gaining support from  stakeholders  standard practices include the reliance on construction methods design and mater ials  that are inappropriate to local climates and conditions  construction and building activities are not  seen as meeting the needs of society and environmental protection but rather for stimulating the  economy  therefore managing the built environment in phnom penh will be a significant future  challenge  the paradigm shift towards creating a more sustainable built environment in the region  certainly requires the participation of all stakeholders public  private partnerships governance  mechanisms and also strategies to encourage its implementation   a problem that was mentioned as prominent is the reliance on 'western' construction methods  designs and materials that are often outdated not energy  efficient inappropriate to local climates  and conditions and impose business and trade models that are expensive and unsustainable  subsequently cement has replaced indigenous materials and is responsible for 8% of carbon  dioxide emissions worldwide  the replication of foreign approaches and building standards was the  result of foreign investment with its corresponding imposed design construction and development  models  this phenomenon is being amplified by the shortage of skilled labour for the constructi on  industry and by the adoption of designs and technologies that have been developed in different  contexts usually in advanced industrialised countries   such prac tice is resulting in dependence on  imported materials and equipment as well as foreign professionals and contractors  the concept of sustainability has only recently been introduced to the building and construction  sector in cambodia   it is not yet an int egral part of decision  making and business practice  the lack  of awareness of sustainability issues in related professions and a lack of capacity amongst planners architects engineers contractors and related stakeholders along with a lack of research and  professional networks makes it obvious that well documented scientific and research references  tools techniques case studies and demonstration projects which are relevant to local conditions are needed   #2 r&d phase is being organised to address some of those issues particularly in  evaluating the current situation of the building stock in phnom penh understanding what the future  would ideally look like both from a sustainability and a desirability point of view and suggesting a  path to get there  raising awareness building capacity sharing and exchanging knowledge is also  going to be part of this process   several lo cal and internation al stakeholders have been identified during the definition phase and  contact has been established to continue exchange during the research and development phase  as  an internatio nal frame for the planned development of a locali sed technical roadmap the unep  globalabc   global alliance for buildings and construction   current global and regional roadmap  developments  globalabc 2020a globalabc 2020b  are used and contact to the globalabc  network has been established  see letter of support at annex    on the local level  for example the  exchange has been set up with the gener al department of housing  gdh  in the ministry of land  management urban planning and construction  mlmupc  already since the build4people  preparation phase the phnom penh c aptial administration  ppc a  through the transdisciplinary  build4people ecocity transition lab process   ectl  and the green building working group of the  national committee for sustainable development  ncsd  through   and with the local  innovative design practice urban living solutions  uls    for the academic and research work  the institute of te chnology of cambodia  itc  has been  attracted as the main research partner of    itc is exception ally qualified to cooperate with    on the topic of sustainable building  as they can provide expertise in the field of architecture  civil engineering and mechanical engineer ing  all these three faculties partner   so that a holistic  design approach can be supported through joint research and local expertise    2  main aims of the r &d phase  the main aim of   research is that buildings in phnom penh will be designed with low overall  environmental impact and at the same time with enhanced quality of life now and in the future  adapted to the local situation   this aim is addressed through the following sub  aims  in depth understanding of aspects of urban living related to buildings like comfort air quality  health and energy and further resource consumption  § detailed analysis of the residential use indoor environment quality  ieq  and the building  physics behaviour of the inhabited apartments  analysis of the interaction between use  functionality energy consumption and quality of life perception   § analysis of the project development project delivery and building operation  development of  means and instruments to s upport building sector professionals to reduce environmental  impact during the whole life cycle of buildings and their neighbourhoods   § development and evaluation of practical interventions and technologic al solutions based on  empirical research of the entire tran sdisciplinary project team and defining pathways on how to  develop technical interventions for the achievement of long  term development goals   § co management of the build4people sustainable building arena process together with     § active participation and input to the build4people ecocity transition lab process    § develop and continue exchange with the technical departments at the relevant ministries  started in the preparation phase and continued in the definition phase    § support capacity building and academi c exchange of the institute of technology of cambodia   itc    § support of master course development at the school of architecture and urban planning  saup  at pannastra university of cambodia   3  state of the art  theory   as a result of the rapid economic development in cambodia lifestyles and needs of the inhabitants  are changing and new building typologies are emerging with materials constructions and supply  systems that were not previously common  given the rapid pace of construction activity  socio  economic development and short  term climate protection goals this development must now take  place much more quickly in phnom penh and in the whole of cambodia and regressions must be  avoided  this development should be aligned with the efforts for improving new and future buildings   with changing comfort requirements the indoor environment is also changing  and occupants are  exposed to new indoor conditions while the outdoor climate is warm and humid year  round  efforts  to save energy and conserv e resources are urgently needed as availability of resources secure  energy supplies environmental pollution and climate change have been identified as pressing  problems by policymakers at the national and global level  the construction sector  with its material  flows and energy demand is a significant contributor to these problems in cambodia   concrete  demand in cambodia was about 7 million tonnes in 2017  and it is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years  the nation thailand 2019    the energy demand in the residential sector  total  final energy consumption  tfec    of cambodia increased at an average annual growth rate of 6 9%  between 2010  2015 coal grew the fastest at 21 2% per year followed by electricity at 18 2% thereby  31% of tfec is attributed to residential use  general department of energy and general  department of petroleum ministry of mines and energy of cambodia 2016     despite the pressuring context  neither the cambodian construction industry nor the residential  sector has sufficiently tried to adapt to the needs of lowering the energy demand and environmental  pollution caused by its activity  it needs to be investiga ted both from an environmental but also from  a peoples  perspective how t o promote such a transition with new designs standar ds and  technolog ies and their integration within the building systems  at present however the building  sector does not have an in  depth understanding and knowledge of sustainability concepts nor the  skills to use them  there is a reported lack of knowledge and willingn ess in advancing the use of  bioclimatic design principles and low energy building system technologies building code adoption  and compliance building and appliances labelling use of audit and building management tools and  building integrated renewable energy systems   according to the international energy agenc y  iea  the number of new buildings likely to be built by  2050 under inadequate energy policies globally is equivalent to 2 5 times the current building stock in the people  republic of china  iea 2019    stalling on high  performance buildings construction  and renovations for an additional ten year period can result in 2 gt of extra co 2 emissions from 3500  million tonnes of oil equivalent of unnecessary energy demand to 2050 increasing global spending on heating and cooling by 2 5 trillion usd  iea 2019    moreover approximately 70% of building floor  area additions will occur in places like cambodia till 2050 with limited building energy codes in place  today  iea 2019    however build ings are not only their environmental impact but also their  interactions with their users and occupants  it is known that we spend 90% of our time indoors  klepeis et al  2015  chapple 2011  and given the increasing interest on health indoor air quality   iaq  and wellness inside buildings it becomes clear that interior spaces should be made healthier    proper indoor environmental quality  ieq  management can reduce indoor ai r pollution and promote  the health of occupants  nitmetawong et al  2019     sustainable building design aims at maximising the quality both of the built environment and of the  life within the building while at the same time minimising negative impacts on the natural  environment  mclennan 2006    with 9 5% of cambodia  population living in phnom penh it has  become apparent that building design processes must address energy demand building form construction materials operation and maintenance and abov e all the long  term and changing needs  of the user population throughout the life cycle of the buildings  williams 2007  nag 2019      level of analysis concern s the building and building design as part of the solution for moving towards  a more sustainable city and an im proved uqol in phnom penh   a sustainable building approach is  considered as a way for the building industry in cambodia to swift to a more sustainable way of  development taking into account environmental socio  economic and governance issues  these  issues were identified within the projec t under the aspect of transformation tow ards better uq ol   the practice of sustainable building refers to various methods in the process of implementing  building projects that involve less harm to the environment preserve natural resources and improve  our quality of life  world green building council 2020    hill and bowen  hill and bowen 1997  state  that sustainable building starts at the planning stage of a building and continues throughout its life to its eventual deconstruction and recycling of resources to reduce the waste stream associated with demolition   within the cambodian context  the sustainability concepts in building design can be realised in  multiple levels  energy consumption is one of them since t he prices of electricity in cambodia are  some of the highest in s outh  east asia  le fevre 2019  and at the same time total electricity  consumption is on the rise  ayman 2020    despite the high local electricity prices the recently  constructed buildings are usually neithe r energy

formulation of a  locali sed roadmap  schwede 2020  aligned to international and regional efforts  globalabc 2020a  globalabc 2020b   a roadmap is a strategic instrument to map out the development path towards a desirable future such as a development goal by 2050 and the required development steps towards such goal for a technol ogy field a policy sector or the entire country but under consideration  of the predicted development of boundary conditions  such a locali sed technical roadmap will be  developed within   for selected techn ology fields towards urban quality of life and sus tainable  building and in relation to the regional and global roadmaps of globalabc and the local efforts of the  national committee for sustainable development  ncsd  in this regard    in summary the goal is to bring balance between the climate and the built environment with  interrelated considerations such as the climate variables human health comfort and technological and architectural solutions in close collaboration with the other wps    #2 contribution in r &d   phase will be an effort to bring togeth er all of these different facets of the building  not only within  the building design level but also within a transdisciplinary perspective  addressing not only    research questions but also related questions from other wps  the following research p lan was  created keeping that in mind not only providing solutions for building level sustainability issues but also produce results that can either support or be supported from other wps providing a holistic and  transdisciplinary approach  4  research plan  the activities of   are planned throughout the four year period of the build4people rd phase  and they are divided into four big worksteps  each one with its own sub  activities   aim is to  develop in collaboration with the other wps the fundamentals of the context of energy  efficient  resource  efficient and sustainable construction in cambodia  all of them from a people  centred  perspective  in   current practices sustainable building tec hnologies and the requirements for  a good indoor environmental qual ity  ieq   for present and future building projects will be examined   first measuring equipment will be installed for long term measurement and evaluation of the indoor  environment in residential buildings in phnom penh  environmental perception and behaviour u ser surveys building physics measurements in the building and detailed building audits are interlinked  in such a way that the transdisciplinarity of the research team is optimally exploited  the surveys are organised in such a way that not only the detailed results of the building audits can be used for  higher levels evaluation  neighbo urhood urban etc    but possibly also transferred to other samples  of similar buildings in cambodia and other locations in the region with similar climate and building  operations  as a key product of   a technical roadmap will be developed to map out a strategy towards  sustaina ble building and urban quality of life   key information gaps will be identified and a ddressed  by collecting data and evidence to support actions to improve the ef ficiency of buildings  along with  build4people sustainable building arena process  jointly managed by   and    and the  build4people sustainable building incubator activation and visioning for trans formation will be  supported and lead into improved building performance and c onstruction methods that ideally would  result in a bigger scale of secoral

5  risk analysis  the implementation of the envisaged activities is obviously subject to risks  however we are  confident to implement the original work plan and that we can respond to all ch allenges effectively   the research structures have already been established during the preparation phase with a reliable  leading local academic partner namely the cambod ian institute of technology   all activities can  effectively be implemented with alternative  but similar setups    § delays in planned measuring campaign  there is a possibility our planned measuring activities  to be delayed or to be hard to find apartments for measurement  through the university itc we  have access to a large number of people to find a comparatively small number of apartments  in  the unlikely case that this is not successful the problem can be dealt with by measuring in  alternative settings such as other types of rooms    § travelling difficulties due to covid  19 travel restrictions this is a likely risk especially during the  1st year of our r&d phase  possible problems can be resolved  for instance  the installation of  the measurement equipment  see  #2 1  can be done by our project partner  although this is  not the pref erred option it can be dealt with since the same difficulties have already been  successfully resolved in similar activities in the camars ec project in vietnam   the   work plan is designed in such a way that its internal work steps   #2 1    #2 2      3 and  #2 4  lead to valuable results alone already and are complemented and refined by  transdisciplinary cooperation within the con sortium and with other partners  therefore the  work  can also be successful when a single partner does not perform as required   6  exploitation plan  6 1  economic success prospects  prospects of economic success  the economic success of the  #2s results can be based on  the transition to a better building stock and construc tion practice in cambodia  the developed  activities in the project can help enhance the quality of life in the buildings but also the quality of the building itself and the quality of the en ergy and technical systems used  it is expected that the policy  requirements as well as the expectations of the users on the building quality in terms of energy and resource efficiency but also in terms of comfort and functionality will incre ase  it will provide the  members of the new emerging middle class  new consumers  in phnom penh with high quality and  sustainable solutions for their homes   it will also lower their energy use and minimi se any health issues related to the indoor environment  furthermore it will positively affect the cambodian  manufacturers and providers of building materials and building systems but also the project  developers and de signers by creating sustainability  related business opportunities   with enhanced  quality requirements european and german suppliers will be more likely to be successful in the  cambodian market in future   germany is a pioneer in the use of new construction systems concerning energy  saving and  sustainable construction  market knowledge and also market acce ss must be developed for the  markets in developing and emerging countries and the climate zone of the tropics  the knowledge  of the market situation and of local building regulations and construction methods gained in the  project and through the network wi ll make it much easier for the german and european construction  industry to gain a foothold in the region and to place its products on the market in the short and medium  term   prospects of operational success  with the help of the knowledge gained in the p roject about  technical contributions to solution and development approaches   #2  for sustainable and people  oriented development in phnom penh and other cities and regions in developing and emerging countries a concrete development roadmap will be defin ed   #2 3  and in particular evaluation  criteria for technical solutions will be provided   #2 4   for the first time this will enable planning  tenders in construction projects and guidelines for sustainable procurement in cambodia  these development  oriented quality indicators and evaluation criteria also particularly strengthen the  implementation of sustainable construction especially in connection with the approaches developed  in the other wps  user perspective   #1  political and social perspective     dissemination  and capacity building        the roadmap development     3  will create a transformation  oriented framework that can  directly be incorporated into future technical development cooperation projects for example  those  of giz adb or undp or by local ministries  appropriate applications of the project results are  systematically prepared at an early stage through discussions with relevant actors in the course of  the project   arena process    the time horizon is strategically set in such a way that with the  necessary preparatory work in the technical disciplines of  #2 in   1 and   2 in project  years 1 and 2 a roadmap will be available at the end of project year 3 which can be incorporated in  parallel and subsequently into a larger technical development cooperation project  ideally such a  development project can then be scientifically accompanied by the project consortium during the build4people implementation phase  6 2  scientific success prospects  the prospects of achieving the objectives of the build4people project can be rated as extremely  good  with the cambodia institue of technology  itc  as our main partner  we work together with  the leading research institute in the field of sustainable building in cambodi a  through the itc our   is linked to the local engineering scene so we can expect our results to have a direct impact on  standardis ation and further activities in the area of sustainable buildings  the cooperation scope of    and itc will be further developed in the course of the project   therefore t he equipment and  methodology implemented will be used in the future to carry out further joint research projects   corresponding research proposals and ideas will be developed in the implementation phase  the  project results will be made available to the scientific and professional audience in reviewed paper  publications  the publications will focus on the technical aspects of the project as well as joint  transdisciplinary publications on governance aspects health and comfort and effective education  and traini ng   the interdisciplinary nature  social science psychology engineering  etc   of the project team  ensures that not only technical solutions are incorporated into this development  a lso the socio   economic and broader market context is taken into account   this holistic people  led approach is an  innovative feature of our projec t and points the way forward for sustainable development in the  building sector   the apparent need also gives the prospect of a successful and impact  oriented implementation of  the research project for locali sed and detailed technical and systemic approac hes to sustainable  development in the building sector and for sustainable development in urban areas  while the basic principles and necessities of sustainable building are well known and have been widely disseminated  worldwide in recent years effective i mplementation requires a detailed analysis  development of  adapted and localised measures among others by means of action research and long  term  strategies    work plan is designed in such a way that its internal work steps     1  #2 2  #2 3 and   4  lead to valuable results and are complemented and  refined by transdisciplinary cooperation within the consortium and with other partners   6 3  economic connectivity  the research in   will contribute research evidence to the development of applicabl e standards  and policies in cambodia  by application of life  cycle assessment  environmental impact and  economic impact  most feasible solutions and concepts will be identified  on the project level as well  as on the level of the cambodian economy   given the high energy prices in cambodia energy  efficient design solutions will benefit buildings owners as well as the achievement of the climate  protection goals   as this project is primarily concerned with research on sustainable development in the buildin g  sector and sustainable urban development the direct economic exploitation of the results is not the  primary objective  however as the construction sector and the built environment is also one of the  most important economic sectors in cambodia the potential economic impact of the project is  evident    the dimensions of local  sustainable development defined in  #2 2 and the assessment criteria  for sustainable construction in cambodia developed in  #2 4 provide impact  oriented instruments  for steering t he building sector  the roadmap developed in  #2 3 will continue to provide impulses  for the development of the building sector and the built environment so that new business areas will be opened up for innovative and responsible market actors  builders planners architects  manufacturers operators    6 4  scientific connectivity  with the development of a roadmap    3  a research agenda for the necessary future technical  and application  oriented development will also be established which will subsequentl y lead to new  research activities at the level of basic research and application  oriented product and system  development  the identified development needs are already addressed during the project e g  via  the business incubator process  but also through other consultations with industry representatives  and also with representatives of local ministries so that scientifically supported application  oriented  developments are initiated   in the medium and long term new research projects will be conceived and implemented by the  applicant from this research agenda together with the research partners of the itc  cambodian  institute of technology  and other partners  regional links are also envisaged e g  via the current  applicant  projects in v ietnam camarsec and rebumat   7  cooperation with third parties  the applicant

international technical cooperation projects for example for the adb  asian development bank  and the undp  these activities will be used to develop a transformation   oriented development perspective   8  property rights and exploitation of results  no property rights or property right applications are discernible that would prevent the later exploitation of the project results  the project is not already the subject of other research developments studies and patents   9  necessity of the research g rant  this project is a research and cooperation project on basic research with implementation and  transformation  oriented components derived from basic research  an economic benefit cannot be  achieved by the research partners during the project peri od  above all the project is based on a  pronounced scientific interest and the desire for academic and scientific exchange with the partners  in the international research consortium and the wider circle of partners in cambodia  furthermore  the project ai ms at developing a scientifically based contribution to sustainable development in the  construction sector and to sustainable urban development in cambodia and other countries in the  region   without the funding applied for the project objectives described above could not be achieved  the  funding for this project is absolutely necessary for the universit y of stuttgart since no budget third   party or own funds are available for this project  the project cannot be carried out without the federal  funds applied for  as a university the universit y of stuttgart is dependent on 100% funding for this  project   10  explanations how   activities during the r&d phase  contribute to trans  disciplinarity  in summary the goal is to bring balance between the climate and the built environment with  interrelated considerations such as the climate variables human health comfort and technological and architectural solutions in close collaboration with the other wps  within   already at itc  the fields of architecture civil engineering and mechanical engineering will work jointly in trans   disciplinary manner with the german research team    will contribute to all joint and  transdisciplinary activities in the build4people project with the technical and engineering  based  perspective    contribution in r &d  phase will be an effort to bring together all of these  different facets of the building not only within the building design level but also within a  transdisciplinary perspective addressing not only    research questions but also related  questions from other wps   the scientific work plan of   is designed in such a way that its internal work steps     1  #2 2  #2 3 and   4  will lead to v aluable results already alone and are  complemented and refined by transdisciplinary cooperation within the consortium and with other  partners  trans  disciplinary connections within the build4people consortium are evident in the    1 where traditional engineering methods of ieq  measurements and environmental behaviour  and comfort user survey methods are applied in combination with   led build4people uqol  household survey but on a more technical level and with fewer participants in indoor environment s     and   will manage together the sustainable building arena process  sba  whereas    is developing a sustainable transition agenda in a participatory stakeholder process   is  utilising this process for the development of a technology roadma p  both developments will support  each other  and   will assess ideas developed in the stakeholder process for feasibility and  environmental impact through lca  methods  the build4people ectl process led by   is  utilised by   to identify topics for technical development  at the same time   will support  the build4people ectl process with technical expertise   11  explanations how   activities during the  r&d phase prepare for implementation phase  the roadmap development     3  will create a transf ormation  oriented framework that will  guide the research team in designing an effective work program in the later implementation phase  the roadmap can directly be incorporated into future technical development cooperation projects  for example  those of giz adb or undp or by local ministries  appropriate applications of the  project results are systematically prepared at an early stage through discussions with relevant actors  in the course of the project   arena process    the time horizon is s trategically set in such a way  that with the necessary preparatory work in the technical disciplines of  #2 in  #2 1 and    2 in project years 1 and 2 a roadmap will be available at the end of project year 3 which can  be incorporated in parallel and subsequently into a

 rough work  and implementation plan of implementation phase the workplan of the implementation phase  2025  2027  will be developed during the build4people  research and development phase  see

the environmental socio  cultural and in stitutional context in  cambodia p articularly in phno m penh  the planning frameworks have been studied  an analysis of  stakeholders for local neighbourhood development was made and vernacular and co ntemporary  urban patterns were compiled   a main insight of the research was to understand the present condition and the constrains of the  urbanization process in phnom penh and cambodia  with the takeoff of the economy the  urbanization process in phnom pe nh is now going very fast and with almost no control  there is  growing need for cities in cambodia to invest in green infrastructure such as green space public space and walkability  flooding has become more serious where private  sector commercial  developments have been constructed in areas that were originally public green spaces natural lakes or wetlands   world bank group 2018 p  42   transportation systems in cambodian cities are not  multimodal or integrated at the moment   although phnom penh has implemented public transport  ridership has been low due to poor tra ffic conditions unreliable schedules and the poor quality of the  buses   world bank group p  31   unfortunately the country went through a dramatic historic event which affected the development of cities and  as a consequence  generates constrains in the present urbanization process  with the  gradual return of the resident population to the city a fter the fall of the khmer rouge  many  properties had been informally occupied and their eventual re  titling favored current occupants  causing numerous conflicts and fictions   icem 2016 p  30  this is one of the reason s why the  government started a program of relocation over the pas t decades in which more than 150000  persons have been displaced at least to 54 relocation sites most of them lacking basic services or  are vulnerable to floods   sina brod p  106   another main insight of the research is on the understanding of the planning system and the overview  of the planning instruments in cambodia a nd phnom penh  while the framework of planning systems  and many planning policies exist the synergy between the two major planning systems  the socio  economic development plan and the spatial plan is not existing  for instance the  recommendations for implementation of economic development plans lack the corresponding spatial plans to establish and safeguard land for identified economic sectors  world bank group  2017b p  47   furthermore most municipalities began establishing offices of urban development  and urban beautification   however the lack of capacity  funding and technical skil lsets  is often a  bottleneck to developing urban spatial and land use plans especially at the khan and sangkat levels  for this reason urban sectoral masterplans are often prepared by donors   world bank group involved in progressive projects and plans which have been studied and taken into account by      this situation gives the build4people project the opportunity to tackle the problem through a series  of capacity building workshop sessions in which all stakeholders local and international experts and  the working packages of the b4p project could work i n a transdisciplinary way  sharing best practices  from europe and southe ast asia in strategic planning and sustainable urban design   a final insight relevant to the research of   was to understand the cultural and historic  conditions of the architecture and urbanization in cambodia that shaped particularly the city of  phnom penh  in this regard  it is important to mention that the city and the country in general has a  valuable cultural heritage  during the colonization period the french brought important engineering  and infrastructural projects  henning and koditek 2020  such as water sewage electricity railway  and boulevards as well as first planning projects of city development with new housing typologies and materials  particularly in phnom penh m any migrant s settle down for trade which is increasing  the multi  cultural character of the city  unfortunately some major planning works in the city did not  respect nature and many of the existing channels and lakes were drained and covered by dir t or  sand   shelby elizabeth doyle 2012    unfortunately this is a practice that has being carried out until  now  as consequence  there is a dramatic disappearance process of lakes and reservoirs increase  of vulnerable areas to floods and other environmenta l problems  however the cultural exchange  with the french was of course very valuable   on the other hand there are some interesting sustainable approaches found in the cultural heritage  of cambodia which are relevant to our research  for instance the impressive sustainable water  management systems from the khmer empire which managed the annual cycle of flooding and made productive use of water rises  vann 2003 p 10   evans and fletcher 2015  or the new khmer  architecture movement which blended modernism with traditional khmer elements    shelby  elizabeth doyle 2012 pp  142– 144   bodach and waibel 2017  p  12    the integration of  architecture to landscape and climate was again visible in this movement buildings were design ed  with green t echnologies such as double roofs cross  ventilation brise soleils indirect lighting  evaporative cooling and the use of local materials  the vann molyvann project 2019     these approaches to su stainability will help to justify and convince stakeholders to use the concepts  strategies and guidelines to sustainable neighbourhood development since many of these are already to find in the culture of cambodia and in the memory of the people        #3 organized the first ecocity transition lab together with andreas von zadow as a n  internationally experienced moderator  the main facilitation of the transdisciplinary build4people  ecocity transition lab was held at phnom penh c apital administration from 01  06 march 2020  the  goal of the collaborative planning workshop was to create an understanding of the relevant local  issues in a case study area in the chbar ampov district  which was previously selected by the loca l  administration  the build4people ecocity transition lab was undertaken by means of active interaction of the international build4people experts’ team  professors and professionals  from germany phnom penh capital administration representatives  includin g architects and urban  planners  local authority housing developers local university professors and other local experts intensively supported by students from the paññāsāstra university of cambodia and of norton university   in a joint post  it session problems – dreams – solutions were identified and prioritized major  issues and potential solutions were explored more deeply in a hands  on planning sessions a design  workshop with several topics such as water green & climate traffic & mobility and social  behavior & education  the design team develop 1st concepts and strategies for the site  based on  the workshop results and represented in a land use plan and an urban structure plan supplemented by contributions from all work packages  this transdisciplinary process shall serve as a starting  point to further discuss and specifically develop an eco  town development within chbar ampov  this  will also serve to develop valid strategies and site selection criteria for sustainable urban development in phnom penh in general and fo r a 1 st conceptualization of strategies and criteria for  sustainable neighbourhoods  for the documentation of the results please see b4p website   https  build4people org   ampov district will be a good basis for the research and development work during the upcoming 4   year  rd phase   other activities were carried out by   such as curating the 1st edition of the exhibition on  green buildings and sustainable neighbourhoods as a roadshow to cambodia  the opening  event exceeded the expectations and attracted high attention among local experts administrative  staff from ppca  developers professors and students  the posters are currently being translated  into khmer language to reach out to an even wider public   for this event an extensive study and analysis of state  of the art sustainable neighbourhood  development projects which have been implemented in europe  was carried out   contributions  from every working package on relevant concepts were collected and expressed in research  posters  for the documentation of the results please see b4p website  https  build4people org      also contributed to the transdisc iplinary school demonstration project participating actively  in a joint workshop organized at the ais  school together with administrative staff from the school  in phnom penh    also gave valuable input to the b4p survey and the quality of life city  index with questions related to sus tainable neighbourhoods   the main aim of   is to increase the sustainability performance in urban development at the  scale  level of neighbourhoods in p hnom penh and cambodia and to improve the urban quality of  life at the same time  therefore innovative planning elements methodologies and processes will be explored in order to infuse sustainability

state of the art  theory   3 1 urbanization process es and planning instruments in cambodia  cambodia is at an early stage of urbanization with 21 percent of people living in cities  which is  considerably lower than other countries in the region  however it is expected that the county will  continue to urbanize at an average annual rate of approximately 2 5 in the next 35 years  and by  2050 it is expected that 36 percent of residents will live in urban areas  world bank group 2017a  p  15   this leads to an unbalanced population growth particula rly in phnom penh which tripled its  population in the past ten years reaching around 2 1 million inhabitants  this urbanization process  pushes a constant influx of low  income workers into the main cities placing a heavy demand for  affordable housing and a strain on natural resources  there is a strong demand for urban renewal and a considerable number of new neighbourhoods with a large socio  cultural economic and  environmental impact  with the substantial improvement of living standards mainly for the middle   class for the next years an increase of energy demand is expected  waibel 2017 p  15   large   scale private developmen ts have significantly increased the housing and commercial real estate  supply for the market  however there is a risk of a real estate market bubble from over  supply and  over priced units due to speculation  especially at high  end condominiums  world bank group 2018  p  39    as consequence of this constrains the royal government of cambodia has adopted a cross  cutting  national green growth policy and strategy since 20 09  the green growth roadmap    iggwg  2009    this has been integrated into the national strategic development plan 2014   2018 and to  the national urban development strategy framework as an essential means for sustainable  development   makathy tep 2016 pp  8–9   under this framework the phnom penh capital  administration  in close collaboration with the national council for sustainable development  ncsd   and the global green growth institute  gggi  launched the phnom penh sustainable city plan 2018   2030  this plan is accompanied by a green city strategic planning methodology which is a  step by step guide for municipalities district and commune officials and the relevant stakeholders of  each municipality across cambodia seeking to embark on the process of transforming their cities  towards green growth  gggi 2019 p  1    the phnom penh sustainable city plan is designed to support the implementatio n of the phnom  penh master plan for land use 2035 through the design of specific green growth actions related to the strategic priorities identified in the master plan  moreover it will support the achievement of the strategic goals set within the phnom penh urban transport masterplan and the phnom penh  masterplan for drainage and sewerage  gggi 2019 p  1    funding and technical skillsets  to develop urban spatial and land use plans especially at the lower  administrative levels  for this reason urban sectoral master plans are often prepared by donor  organizations   world bank group 2017b p  26      3 2 relevance of sustainable neighbourhoods  with the constant shifting of the population from rural to urban areas the urbanization process is  one of the main demographic mega  trends  more than half of the world´s population live already in  cities  in 2018 already 55% of the inhabitants were living in urban areas and this phenomenon will  continued to increase up to 68 % by 2050 according to urban population projection  un 2019     urbanization has generally been a positive force for economic growth poverty reduction and human  development  un 2018   however t his trend also has tremendous socio  economical and  environmental consecuences when there is a lack of susta inable planning practices   for instance  cities account for about 70 per cent of global carbon emissions and over 60 per cent of resource  use  un 2019   the resulting urban growth could have a negative impact in biodiversity increase  global warming climate change growth of slums social  inequity access to basic services and  infrastructure vulnerable natural risk desasters and even deseases  such as the covid  19  pandemic    responding to the se challenges countries and governments have signed the 2030 agenda for  sustainable development and were committed to integrate the un sustainable development goals  and targets into their national development plans and to align policies and institutions behind them   these address the global challenges we face including those related to poverty inequality climate  change environmental degradation peace and justice  the sustainable development goal 11  sustainable cities and communities is a commitment to making cities inclusive safe resilient and  sustainable  un 2019     the paris agreement in 2015 was another major commitment to keep global warming increase of  1 5 to a maximum of 2 degrees celsius and therefore to reduce risks and impacts of climate change   unfccc 2015    however these agreements laws and instruments are not sufficient to resolve the problem  in this  regard sustainable neighbourhood development is a potential solution to address this rapid  urbanization process with all these constrains   they are considered as key elements for a more  sustainable city growth  moreover as socio  spatial units neighbourhoods offer a suit able scale of  intervention for integrated planning measures for sustainable urban redevelopment  franke 2011  bott et al  2019    economic infrastructure  the focus should be on people aspirations and needs  but at the same  time sustainable neighbourhoods should address climate protection and climate change for the  open spaces the building patterns and the technical infrastructure  furthermore energy  efficient  urban layout in neighbourhoods is an essential for effectively and economically implementing strategies to reduce pollution from buildings and supply systems  bott et al  2019     sustainable neighbourhoods include an added value for the environmental people and society and  for the economy  for instance s ufficient green and open spaces provide animal and plant habitats  as well as an improve ment of micro climate thus human well  being and he alth also rises  mixed use  the provision of facilities for daily life and public and leisure spaces contribute to the sense of  community  furthermore good access to public transport also contribute to low traffic levels  it  promotes environmentally frie ndly m obility and increases safety   resource efficiency in energy  water building materials and other valuable re sources as well as more generally land cost and time  also contribute to   for instance  massive construction maintenance and service costs for traffic  areas  streets car parks  can be cut  thus more space could be dedicated to high  quality residential  infill development  anders 2019       3 3 integrative masterplanning and multi  layered design approaches  an important approach to sustainable neighbourhoods is to integrate relevant experts and aspects  of sustainable development as explored in the ecocity project  see figure 1   these aspects are  related to the sectoral design of the urban structure transport system energy and material flows a  community way of life and the urban e conomy  the success ful implementation depends on such  integrated planning approach   philine gaffron gé huismans franz skala 2005 p  17   this constitutes the core of sustainable urbanism  it is based on acknowledging the complexity of every urban process and is trying to tackle this complexity by focusing mainly on the  interrelationships among different fields and sectors but without negle cting the necessity of  appropriate sector  specific solutions  the key issues of integrated planning are a multidisciplinary  approach an iterative  i e  repeated and ongoing  processes of analysis and a holistic integration of the results obtained throu gh sectoral analysis  philine gaffron gé huismans franz skala 2005  p  38         another interes ting approach is the multi layered neighbourhood development strategy as applied  for the umore project in minneapolis in cooperation the university of minneapolis and based on a  participatory design process support integrated design approaches for achieving synergetic effec ts  and a high sustainability profile  joachim eble architektur et al  2011    the urban planning complexity could be addressed with this multi layered neighbourhood  development strategy which is a great tool that helps to understand and to propose solutions to  each main sector without getting lost while trying to resolve everything at once  it also helps to identify  charac teristics of different systems and their interrelations   joachim eble architektur et al    the visualization of synergetic effects between the involved sec tors and disciplines is a key issue  to support handling the complexity of sustainable neighbourhood development  it also helps to  identify and understand sectoral problems and to create specific solutions as a part of the holistic  approach  anders messerschmidt 2019    3 4 assessment systems  the rating system for sustainable urban districts considers the following quality sections ecology  economy socio c ulture and function technology a nd process  the scheme includes all areas  relevant to sustainable building from the loc ation and energy supply of the district to public space  amenities and mixed use s ustainable mobility and reducing costs throughout the entire life cycle    dgnb   this is the only rating system until now carefully dedicated to urban districts   the criteria  of each section mentioned below form the basis for a conceptualization of sustainable  neighbourhood in cambodia and a further development of a rating system adapted to the  cambodian context  3 5 participati on processes  the key factor is delivering sustainable urban neighbourhoods is process quality  the planning  process can be improved by including innovat ive participation processes  the design and  management shall be based on citizens’ and user interactive participation proc esses  which should  be highly communicative for all involved parties and which focus on exchanging information  generating creative solutions and building consensus between stakeholders  rolf messersc hmidt  andreas von zadow 2019    furthermore early engagement of all stakeholders and coordinating  goals shared by property owners investors elected councilors and municipal planning departments  as well as interested citizens allows for the develop ment of an integrated planning process  this  process aims above all at reaching consensus and is appropriate for developing interdisciplinary  design workshops such as the community planning events  this methodology combines  workshops and hands  in planning sessions with a charrette and a repor t back session within one  week  zadow 1997 campion 2018     3 6 basic methodologies and a starting point  these shall support the research and development activities  the  methodologies will be transformed and adapted to the cambodian context  § the european framework for sustainable urban planning

the scale  level of  neighbourhood development in an already defined cas e study area in the khan chbar ampov  but  also the wider context of the khan and the interrelations with the entire city of phnom penh will be  considered  this masterplan will be deepened and further elaborated based on c oncepts that have  been developed in the definition phase in a v ery successful first ecocity transit

and  river front projects  furthermore  interventions in existing urban environments also as a precondition  for the integration with new developments and the urban  rural integration of city edge developments  will be explored  obtained through multidisciplinary and sectoral analysis  in order to tackle the complexity of urban  processes specific concepts in each sector and field should be developed first  without neglecting these sectoral solutions the mutual integration to a holistic and integrative approach in an iterative process will be a key issue   philine gaffron gé huisman s franz skala 2005 p  38    this process will be carried out with a multi  layered approach  see fig  9  which will include  transdisciplinary input from all work packages of the b4p project as well as from local research and implementation partners  the conceptual impulses by the b4p team will include social infrastructure  and structure  physical & behav ior change  sustainable building  energy efficiency and supply   urban green  analysis program and network  urban climate  preconditions guidelines simulation  and urban transformation  institutional context and stakeholder management    the ecocity transition lab methodology will also be a major contributor to the collaborative mast erplanning process  the idea is to introduce an active participatory planning process which will  be highly communicative for all involved parties and which wi ll focus on exchanging information messerschmidt andreas von zadow 2019    this methodology combines a s eries of interactive  workshops with a charette as a compact and highly effective design workshop and a report  back  session within one week  zadow 1997 campion 2018     the final product is an integrative & collaborative masterplan framework including a land use plan  urban structure plan and related sustainability concepts  these will also serve to develop valid  strategies and criteria for sustainabl e urban development in phnom penh and cambodia in general     4 1 3  toolbox for sustainable neighbourhood development  the b4p toolbox for sustainable neighbourhood development will be a transdisciplinary product   which will include a catalogue of strategies guidelines and criteria incl  lca  life cycle assessment   and life cycle costs  lcc    these will be derived from the integrative masterplan framework for  the ca se study area in phnom penh and adapted european and south  east  asian approaches to  sustainable masterplanning  in particular the advanced assessment system for sustainable urban  districts developed by the german sustainable building council  dgnb 2020  w ill be an important  starting point   the provided strategies and guidelines will promote integrated and improved planning processes for  sustainable neighbourhoods  a specific set of criteria will define minimum and advanced requirements for sustainable deve lopment and should be applied to the city of phnom penh and  other cities in cambodia  the conceptualization of an assessment system for supporting the  implementation will be carried out in cooperation with german sustainable building council dgnb  dgnb    the applica tion will be illustrated and showcased with the integrative & collaborative  masterplan framework for the study area in chbar ampov   one key issue will be the visualization of synergetic effects between

approach shou ld promote the  development of strategies guidelines and criteria for the toolbox sustainable neighbourhood  development  at the same the ecocity transition labs are expected to be a strong instrument for  local capacity building at phnom penh capital city hall  ppc a  and all other participants of the  events   the first ecocity transition lab event in 2020 in the definition phase of the b4p project has been  carried out very successfully and resulted in a site analysis first masterplan concepts and related  sustainability strategies  a main effect was a deepened understanding of the local planning issues  for all participants and particularly building trust with ppch and a major developer of the study area   all work packages of the b 4p team incl  local research and implementation partners will be involved  in this transdisciplinary process to address complex sustainable urban development issues  a  particularl y strong link will be with the b4p sustainable building arena process of    the entire  ecocity transitio n lab process will be supported by establishing a stakeholder management   the methodology which is based on a community planning approaches  zadow 1997 campion  2018  combines a series of interactive workshops with a compact and highly effective design  workshop and a report  back session within one week  charette    after an introduction the ecocity transition lab kick  off workshop starts with a discussion  workshop about ‘problems   dreams –solutions’ which is derived from robert jungk future  workshops  jungk and müllert 1987    the process will be either for invited groups of participants or  open to the public  the subsequent hands  on planning sessions are for deepening the identified  issues and will lead to the production of sketchy drawings by parallel topical or multidiscipli nary  the results of the kick  off workshop will be taken as a basis for a charrett e as an integrated design  workshop by the international and multidisciplinary b4p research & design team as well as local  partners  this workshops will be supported by several meetings with ppca and relevant local  organizations

discussion of the results and the way  forward will close the planning and consultation week   the planned three ecocity transition labs will have changing topics and participants for the r& d  phase of the buld4people project  the first ecocity transition lab will focus on the masterplan study  area & design strategies the second ecocity transition lab on neighbourhood plans & guidelines  and the third ecocity transition lab on criteria & implementation strategies   this process will be linked with a stakeholder management process for deriving input for the planning  process and for capacity building at the involved parties  therefore three groups will be formed the  support group  local experts departments of city administration local universities e tc   should  promote the process while

milestones2021 2022 2023 2024 the implementation of the envisaged activities is obviously subject to risks  however we are  confident to implement the original work plan and that we can respond to all challenges effectively   the research structur es have already been established during the definition phase with reliable  partners namely the school of architecture and urban planning  saup  of the paññāsāstra  university of cambodia as research partner and phnom penh capital administration  ppca  as  implementation partner   § travelling difficulties due to covid  19 travel restrictions this is a likely risk especially during  the first 6 months of our rd phase  but possible problems can be resolved for instance by  establishing web  based meetings with the local partners as successfully applied  and focusing  on theoretical parts of the sub  work packages   § difficulties with participatory events a nd workshops due to covid  19 restrictions e g  due to  required distances between participants the experience of the last months is that some  participation events could take place with changed formats even within these circumstances   examples for adapted methodologies are working with a stronger role of then more facilitators  and projecting work flows on screens instead of flip  chart writing while the participants are  keeping the distance to each other and the facilitators  citizens can be informed by str eaming  of events on the internet  even stakeholder management processes can be carried out with moderated and interactive video conferences using also chat functions and software tools that  support the splitting up to smaller workings groups  creative gro up processes can be  promoted via web  based whiteboards for collaborating with remote participants   § if very unexpectedly one local partner would reduce its planned engagement there are still  remaining options for a successful cooperation  due to the linkag e with two local partners and  the intended additional collaboration with developers and consultants all research activities  can still be undertaken probably with a just slightly changed set  up   despite the intended iterative processes the   work pla n provides the opportunity to work on  each of the sub  work packages individually and to achieve the expected high quality research  results  thus the contributions to transdisciplinary processes and products can also largely be  guaranteed even if one field of activity cannot be carried out exactly as planned   6  exploitation plan  6 1  economic s uccess prospects  the elaborated contents methodologies and tools provide a very good basis for an economically  successful application strategies and guidelines for sustainable neighbourhoods in order to make projects future  proof

very relevant fields  of sustainable urban development which are crucial for climate protection and c ombatting climate  change  § further development of multi  layered and collaborative planning strategies and methodologies  for implementing sustainable neighbourhood development  § evaluation of eco  town developments and sustainable neighbourhoods with regard to  sustainability criteria and indicators  § presentation at conferences publications in leading journals and contribution to the work of  the international green building council  gbc   6 3  economic and scientific connectivity  good economic and scientific connectivi ty is given particularly within the following fields of activity  § provision of research evidence for polices in the field of sustainable neighbourhoods in  cambodia with strategies and guidelines x  § provision of mandatory minimum requirements for sustainable neighbourhood development for  § assessment system with criteria and indicators incl  lca and lcc supports the identification  and implementation of the best solutions  § a certification system as an importa nt part of the quality assurance and for marketing projects  with a measurable high sustainability profile  § education program for city administrations on sustainable neighbourhood development will  support the qualification of the staff which will promote ad vanced design implementation and  management of neighbourhoods  7  property rights and exploitation of results  generally no property rights or property right applications are discernible that would prevent the  later exploitation of the project results  the only issue to be resolved is the copyright s of photos  and other graphic material for publishing the poster exhibitions   the project is not already the subject of other research developments studies and patents   8  necessity of the research grant  this project is a research and cooperation project on basic research with implementation and  transformation  oriented components derived from basic research  an economic benefit cannot be  achieved by the research partners during the project period  above all th e project is based on a  pronounced scientific interest and the desire for academic and scientific exchange with the  partners in the international research consortium and the wider circle of partners in cambodia   furthermore the project aims at developing a scientifically based contribution to sustainable  development in the construction sector and to sustainable urban development in cambodia and  other countries in the region   without the funding applied for the project objectives described above could not be achieved  the  funding for this project is absolutely necessary for the architects and urban designer practice eble  messerschmidt partner since no budget third  party or o wn funds are available for this project in  the required dimension  the project cannot be carried out without the federal funds applied for  as  a private sme company eble messerschmidt partner can cover a part of the project costs but is  dependent on 70% additional funding for this project   the   on sustainable neighborhoods is strongly linked to joint activities of the build4people   b4p  project  particularly the too lbox for sustainable neighbourhood development and the ecocity  transition labs  ectl  are two major b4p products and processes  furthermore the elaboration of  an integrative & collaborative masterplan framework for a case study area in phnom penh is  another trans  disciplinary key element of the b4p project involving all work packages   furthermore  the two poster exhibitions  curated by   are major contribution s to the joint dissemination of  b4p contents and results  these activities which are mutually in tegrated with the entire project will  be led by   and will include input from all other work packages   beyond this  #3 sustainable neighbourhoods  will also be engaged in other transdisciplinary  knowledge co  production processes  valuable input and active participation will be carried out for  the sustainable building arena process the sustainable building business incubator process and  the build4people urban quality of life process    will support these activities and events giving  relevant input from the sustainable neighbourhood development perspective   10  explanations how   activities during the r&d  phase  prepare for implementation phase  the planned donor implementation workshops will provide a platform to promote the activation of  donor organizations  furthermore the collaborative research and planning methodology involving  many different parties from different professional fields will also contribute to this and for investigating  implementation projects  at the moment the following potential sub  projects have been identified  the conceptualization of the toolbox for sustainable neighborhood development  see   4   provides the opportunity to a deepened largely extended and much more interactive toolbox version  by the transfer of research results on sustainable neighbourhoods into an advanced and web  based  it tool  incl  strategies guidelines criteria and best practice data base   this s hall provide different  information adapted to different target groups such city administrations consultants developers  universities and ngos  this can also be the starting point for the development of other tools for  sustainable design and planning to support the application of sustainability strategies and criteria   e g  planni ng and assessment software    starting from the identified minimum and advanced requirements for sustainable neighbourhood  development a policy guide can be developed to promote g reen neighbourhood development in in  phnom penh and cambodia  the exemplar implementation of such a sustainable neighborhood  secondary cities of cambodia in cooperation with phnom penh capital hall  ppca  other  munic ipalities and local developers   based on the ecocity transition lab  see   5  experiences with ppca administrati on an  education program for city administrations could be set  up for the implementation and testing of the  newly developed train  the trainer units  next to this the new format can include lecturing workshops  and consultation and would contribute to an increased knowledge and understanding about issues  of sustainable neighbourhoods among staff of city administrations and other institutions in  cambodia    a certification system for sustainable neighbourhoods  see   3  could be set  up with the  cambodia gr een building council  cgbc  which is currently established with support of some  architects and developers as well as eurocham  this institution for the certification of sustainable  neighbourhoods and buildings could be supported by the cooperation with th e german sustainable  building council  dgnb  and its experience in developing and marketing certification processes   the green building council can also form the basis for a knowledge platform for the building and  construction industry in cambodia  the out come could be a report on the implementation of a  certification system for neighbourhoods to cambodia    the case study area for the integrative & collaborative masterplan framework  see   2  on the  urban fringe of phnom penh could be the location of a demonstration project for urban  rural  integration  a new blue  green infrastructure combining farming and urban green water management  and renewable energy sources in an innovative material flow concept with synergetic effects could  be funded by the giz or adb  the goal would be create a cutting edge and exemplar project for  phnom penh cambodia and southeast asia     the workplan of the implementation phase  2025  2027  will be developed during the b4p  research and development phase  see

planning in phnom penh and how does transdisciplinary geospatial and citizen  science research methods of b4p     can improve urban quality of life in phnom penh    research sub  questions  1  what are the spatial dimension distribution and the inter  connection of urban green  space  infrastructure  in the khans and sangkats of the phnom penh municipality   core city  and its urban fringe ?  2  is there a spatial relation concerning urban green space distribution and detectable  critical hotspots areas of urban heat islands     in the phnom penh municipality  and the attached urban hinterland or peri  urban area?  3  how can we employ modern technica l modern communication devices to gain people  centered perspective of perceived greenness in relation to urban quality of life using a  transdisciplinary approach by combining different scientific disciplines       and     4  how can we link objective and subjective data gained from uqol survey and urban  green space analysis and relate those to urban quality of life using a statistical model  approach?      insights from definition phase  lessons learned   urban green space  ugs  is essential for the well  being of people living in phnom  penh and ugs is in the focus of urban planning and sustainable development in the  municipality of phnom penh   finding from 1st b4p eco city transition lab    planning  monitor ing and management of ugs in phnom penh has not yet a formal  status in the city planning structures and procedures   no planning standards formal  regulations or methods are available or applied within the phnom penh municipality    assessing quantifying and monitoring ugs is relevant for the research of urban  quality of life as well as for the phnom penh municipality or for land developers from  the real estate sector  the suggested buld4people toolbox for sustainable  neighbourhoods and development     will contain a u gs assessing and  monitoring module   phnom penh municipality and its l and developers tend to take or borough ideas and  concepts for ugs development from other asian cites but are proud of individual solutions in  coopera ting national symbols and icons   during the preparation phase some research about the spatial distribution and regional  dimension of ugs has been started yet    one main difficulty for assessing ugs and considered planning measures are the  mismatch between a dministrative borders of phnom penh the actual urbanized area  and the area of the 2030 phnom penh master plan as well as the conceptual  heterogeneity of ugs types    the latter one is addressed with the ugs typology of ugs in phnom penh  expected  result of the ongoing definition phase   this generalized ugs typology can be used  beyond the scope of this project and will reduce ambiguous heterogeneity of ugs in sustaina ble planning and will reduce mismatch of ugs monitoring across cities in  future research    output of the r&d phase      ugs and its role in the quality of life in urban areas have not yet become a regular  content in respective school and university curricula in cambodia and neighboring  asian cities and countries    modern innovative medium to large  scale land developers in asia are recognizing the  importance of ugs but interpret its accessibility and openness to the public differently    urban citizen of phnom pe nh are concerned about shrinking ugs per capita and  shrinking accessibility of ugs in phnom penh due to gated borey developments     milestones and main aims from the definition phase of   achieved such  as    a  detecting and mapping urban green structu res in the municipality in phnom penh at  district and sangkat level    result of def  phase milestone achieved with professional support from rua and the   phnom penh municipality  output of def  phase spatial database of ugs structures in phnom penh is av ailable   to all b4p  and will be integrated by   and     predominately    b  drafting a typology of urban green spaces  partly achieved work in progress      result of def  phase  with the new ugs typology for phnom penh   has   successfully contributed to a wider transdisciplinary   understanding of the ugs typology in the b4p team and the   phnom penh municipality   output of def  phase  catalogue of ugs types in phnom penh is available to all b4p    and will be integrated by   and     predominately     c  testing the green index and the u rban n eighbourhood green i ndex methodology  at various mapping scales    result of def  phase  both indexes have been successfully tested during the b4p   definition phase  results are work in progress and will be a final  outcome of def  phase    will apply the urban green neighbourhood index in the   r&d phase across phnom penh and at diff erent scales     d  integrating research results of  # 4 with partnering wps # 1 3 and 5    result of def  phase    and   are developing a joint research method to   integrate ugs into the urban quality of life   outcome of def  phase    and   are spatially linking the topic of u rban climatic  structures and processes with the spatial dimension of ugs   together we aim to create an urban green space assessment decomposing green indicators and users perception of green space into qua ntifiable and measurable categories  we will  implement a citizen science project using mobile devices     e  achieved transdisciplinary   activities during the build4people d efinition phase  results of def  phase  the build4people tested their working methods within the definition phase with local research partner and the other   members  opportunities to communicate research ideas to a  wider audience was the build4people ecocity transition lab  and the 1 st edition of the build4people poster exhibition both  held in march 2020   outcome of the def  phase     piloted a blue green city approach    adapted  their research focus accordingly to this idea and investigates now the spatial dimension of green infrastructure and its inter  connectivity in phnom penh  for more details refer to the  chapter state of art    the build4people poster exhibition gave great opportunities to  show best research pra ctice for our specific  related topics  and allowe d to communicate those to a wide public interested in  the overall build4people project goals     working experience with our main research partner    the joint research cooperation with rua as the main research partner of   has been  proven successful reliable and will be continued and enlarged with faculty staff capacity  building joint curriculum design organization of online work studios and summer schools and  the exchange of faculty staff in the r&d phase    joint activities with rua during the build4people definition phase   during the definition phase    in conjunction with rua – flmla  carried out successful  field work and training using the mobile app  input app  the training data was collected to  establish ground  truth points for a comprehensive land cover classification  during the  fieldwork we successfully surveyed and verified 630 out of a proposed 724   before starting the  field work the research team create d attribute data forms and adjusted spatial data layers for  the mobile app according to the b4p project needs  in addition the research team from  hnee wrote a handbook that included a catalogue of different land  cover types to ensure a  uniform mapping methodology and a common understanding of the selected land  cover types   the alignment of both data sets resulted in a new urban green space typology  trends and a  collection of geotagged photography   it will initially serve as a research tool in the build4people  rd phase    mains aims of the build4people rd phase   main aim + sub aims   the main aim of the research phase is to map and to assess urban green  infrastructure  with  particular regards to parameters of quality and connectivity of ugs using a geospatial  approach in phnom penh  linking the objective spatial results to subjective citizen perception  and gaining insides into uqol indicators     1  compute and operationalize urban

refinement of the urban green neighbourhood index for open space planning in pnh   4  derive a statistical model to compare the cause and e ffect from objective and  subjective data regarding uqol      state of the art  theory     during the first phase of the rd  phase the societal and scientific problem  based research     will investigate the actual role and function of urban green  infrastructure  in phnom  penh sustainable urban planning  we will apply a landscape approach using remote sensing  and gis – based calculation in order to map the spatial dimension of urban green   infrastructure  and its inter  connectivity  the reader wi ll be introduced to the overall concept  of green infrastructure  gi  and to the term ecosystem services  ess  as those elements  combine the socio  economic and environmental benefits provided by gi  urban green spaces   ugs  will also be addressed  the integration of the gi concept into strategic policies will be  discussed in global  albeit mainly european and asian  context     research evidences that intact ecosystems within cities considerably improve s the quality of  citizens’ lives  ugs or the fabric of urban green infrastructure  ugi  such as parks city forests  green roofs creeks and streams as well as community gardens provide a broad range of ecosystem services  ess   urban heat mitigation storm water infiltration local food security  physical recreation and psychological well  being of residents  natural environment and open  spaces within city boundaries  core city  have been decreasing continuously  according to  lang et al   2008  urban agglomerations can experience a rapid decline in both the quality and  quantity of urban green spaces   this process is accelerated by unplanned densification of  inner cities and spontaneous leap frog development of urban agglomerations at their urban  fringes  urban fringes refer to the transition zone between the built  up area and the  countryside constituting the inter face between the consolidated urban and rural areas  it is a  zone of mixed land uses where there is often competition for land use eea  2017a    lack of  knowledge or wilful disregard of the importance of urban green spaces in future progressive  urban planning and development will lead to a reduction in the overall quality of life in cities   who 2017    thus a proper evaluation of ugs therefore requires not only information on its  relative spatial quantity in any given area of a municipality but also a closer examination of  ugs in terms of quality and related ecosystem services which can be derived from its land  cover com position and spatial structure  in 1999 niemelä stated  […] that understanding the ecological pat terns and processes of  landscape elements is key to the study of urban ecology   niemelä 1999    he builds on the  conceptual work of forman et al   1986  to differentiate between different land use types  […]  according to the intensity of human influence […] pristine natural environments to urban  centres highly modified by people   niemelä 1999    the assessment of gi already a complex  area of research is further problematized by the effects of long term natural processes such  as climate change which effect the growth and maturation of living elements  smaniotto costa  et al  2008  ‘ one aspect of sustainable urban planning  and the one dealt with in this study  is  the active development creation and maintenance of urban green  infrastructure  and its  biodiversity in the city core an d its urban fringes  despite the benefits relatively little attention  has been paid to the issue of urban green in cambodia as evidenced by phnom penh new  master plan for 2035   an early definition from benedict and mcmahon  2002  highlighted the importance of ugs  networks that provide ecosystem services for people   he refers to gi or blue  green  infrastructure explain ing it as a network providing the ingredients for solving urban and  climatic challenges by building with nature  gi is comprised of a network of near  natural and  designed spaces and elements in cities planned and maintained in such a way that the  infrastructure as a whole offers high quality in terms of utility biodiversity and aesthetic appeal  while also delivering a broad range of ecosystem services  regardless of ownership or origin  all types of sites and individual elements  characterised by vegetation or w ater can become  components of the gi  these concepts originated in the mid 1980s proposals for best  management practices aimed at achiev ing more holistic storm water quantity management  goals for runoff volume reduction erosion prevention and aq uifer recharge  elliott et al  2020     the gi approach has gained increasing importance over the last decades and is by now  recognized and implemented in various fields of science urban policy and city planning  cvejic  et al  2015   the gi analytic framework allows an analysis of green space in terms of its multi   functionality  according to dennis et al   2018  the gi approach considers physical and  functional interconnectivity and relates those to the ability of ecosystems to  […] deliver  multiple valuable ecosystem goods and services […]   eea 2017c    the inclusion or    integration of diverse social ecolog ical and economic benefits within the ugi concept  strengthens cities’ resilience and adaptability through landscape diversity in the face of climate  change  researchers use the term ugi to emphasize the particularity of cities in the application of gi   it includes primarily two land cover types blue and green space  blue spaces refers to  surfaces covered by water oceans rivers streams deltas lakes canals ponds and wetlands  due to its climat e and its geographical location at the mekong delta water is an important  environmental feature for phnom penh  however most spatial analysis of ugi concentrate on  the vegetated land cover type  the ugi approach considers urban green spaces to be assets  that offer multifaceted benefits for citizens and the urban environment  ugs also operates at various scales from single trees  point features  and small linear features  pocket parks  to  large natural and semi  natural areas  private gardens green roofs and sustainable wastewater  treatment systems are all important elements of the urban ecosystem  cvejic et al  2015  haase et al  2019    the potential of urban green and blue spaces to provide benefits to  citizens  ess  depends on whether they are managed as a comprehensive system of ugi or as isolated patches falling under the responsibility of different stakeholders  haaland and van  den bosch 2015    sustainable urban planning should also consider the citizen centred  perspective  lang et al  2008   and social features linked to urban green space  gupta et al   2012 chen et al  2018   in general the literature relates ess to different strategic frameworks for example elliott et  al   2020  draw s their definition from the united nations millennium ecosystem assessment   mea  defining ess very broadly as the benefits people obtain from ecosystems  cvejic et  al   2015  provides a more nuanced definition by highlighting that ess benefits derive from  functioning nature or from ecosystem processes  for cities researchers use the term urban  ecosystem services  urban ess  which uses a different classification system   according to  cvejic et al   2015  in most cases the y are separated into four categories provisioning  services regulating services habitat or supporting services and cultural services  teeb  2011    elliott et al   2020  identify the difficulty in linking ess benefits to certain gi types  however they do recommend that researchers consider […] cultural services in future gi  research and pla nning efforts   elliott et al  2020   on the european level gi is included in the policies of the eu 2020 biodiversity strategy and  since 2013 has been adopted as a […] successfully tested tool for providing ecological  economic and social benefits through natural solutions   ec–europe an 2013    gi has also  become integral to the language of the european commission and most recently the approach  was used in the creation of the resource efficiency roadmap  part of the eu2020 resource  efficiency flagship   eea 2017b    nonetheless municipal practice often lacks the conditions  necessary to safeguard and development green spaces and open spaces in sufficient quality  and quantity  parker and zingoni de baro  2019  compiled a detailed quantitative review of the  gi approach in urban environments and found that there is still a research gap in most parts of the world and importantly for us particularly in asia  further parker and zingoni de baro   2019  state that most research was conducted for regions and cities within temperate and  cold climate hence the outcomes and conclusions are difficult to apply globally   the regional assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services for asia and the  pacific’  ipbes 2018   distributed by ‘the i ntergovernmental science  policy

cambodia was  in 2010  the first country in asia to adapt a national green growth roadmap   to bridge our theoretical knowledge to the practical approach of the build 4pople project and  to our study area phnom penh we refer to the ecocity  transition lab held in march 2020  where b4p guided by    piloted a blue green city approach  phnom penh  has grown  rapidly in recent years and has a high urban expansion rate  world bank group 2017    this  growth has been accompanied by poor urban planning  unfpa 2015  that has resulted in  both reduced natural areas and agricultural land  kompheak 2015    authorities and citizens  of phnom penh now recognize that in fast growing cities like phnom penh sustainable urban  planning is of crucial importance  during the build4people ecoc ity transition lab in mar ch  2020 s takeholder discussion on visions and expectations for urban planning in the chbar  ampov district  and a series of participatory hands  on planning applications  showed that  sustainable and participatory urban development  such as recognizing ugs leads in the  direction of sustainable urban development  which recognizes the goals and ideas of sdg11  the authorities recogniz ed this and t ook it into consideration when drawing up phnom penh   specific green growth action plan detailed in the ‘sustainable city plan 2018  2030’  moreover  the government desire to achieve economic growth in an environmentally sustainable  manner resulted in the development of the ‘sustainable city plan 2018 – 2030’ for which it  collaborated with the ‘glob al green growth institute’  gggi 2019    gggi connects specific  objectives to urban green spaces and summarizes those under the categories ‘public spaces’  and ‘cultural heritage’  the gggi  2019  lists four direct actions that cities should take    ø increase the green canopy coverage of the city  number of new native trees planted   ø increase public green space in the city  number of hectares from current baseline of  70 ha   ø develop a strategic plan to preserve urban cultural heritage  number of histori c  buildings inventoried and protected   ø increase in tourism as a result of improved cultural heritage management  number of  tickets sold at key urban sites  ‘    the build4people project and in particular our   research group takes these directives  as the entry point to promoting the concept of science based ugi and to use the results of gi  based research to formulate recommendations and create planning tools in coordination with  the phnom penh municipality  ppch  and other relevant local stakeholders  gi is an approach  that requires spatial and regional development planning across different scales from the  citywide level to its urban fringes and its neighbourhoods   the importance of spatial analysis in the assessment of urban green infrastructure is well  developed in the literature   gupta et al  2012 liu et al  2016 who 2016 eea 2017a  dennis et al  2018 le texier et al  2018    various studies also evaluate the interconnection  of ecological networks using remote sensing geographic information systems and spatial  statistics  in addition to general analysis on the kind of nature existing in the study area they  further identify specific green space parameters  indicators  such as accessibility availability  and usage of green space  the indicator usage is more difficu lt to analyse as it includes the  perceived greenness by citizens connected to urban quality of life and well  being  moreover  the report of who  2016  offers a detailed literature review of the mentioned parameters and  establishes the link to health and well  being of citizens  in general urban green spaces are  made for p eople and thus represent public values  smaniotto costa et al  2008    how the  public perceives such spaces depends on their characteristics the number of trees the  dimensions etc  this is crucial for the build4people project as one of its main goals is to  understand and positively contribute to the enhancement of the overall quality of life in cities  in general with a research focus on phnom penh  assessing these by using the above   mentioned spatial applications we gain a kno wledge base on the spatial distribution  connectivity and fragmentation of ugi  chan and lee  2019  have evaluated sustainable city  indicators for cambodia  in their research they linked specific green indicators to the un  sustainable development goal sdg11 the korea han  han and lee 2017   and the asean  environmentally sustainable city  s ome of these indicators in the category ‘public space and  heritage’ can be linked to the green indicators presented by the who  2016  and the gggi   2019     calculating the availability of green space for example provides insights into ‘the ratio of  public green space compared to the total area of the city’ which links to the sg11 esc and  han   the indicator ‘accessibility’ provides insight into the ‘percentage of residents residing  in public and green spaces accessible within a certain distance  here 05km ’  this links to the sdg11 or the ‘number of urban parks’ which refers to development goals of the korean  han  han and l ee 2017   we now try to take all the defined green indicators into  consideration and due to our thorough comprehensive literature review during the definition  phase of this project and technical test runs concerning the index calculation we concluded  that the urban neighbourhood green index  ungi  introduced by  gupta et al  2012  is the  most suitable for investigating phnom penh ugi  this is true particularly because of its  applicability by local administrations another goal of the project  w e aim that outcomes will  support the process of building an ugi strategy and further facilitates the search for solutions and new ideas to develop and manage gi and make it to a key role of cambodian policies in  future  however we also found that certain modifications to the ungi are needed for the  successful implementation of this approach  the main modification foreseen the ch ange of  the entry dataset of urban green and will assign different weights per indicator according to  the leading expert interviews of the phnom peng municipality and other local stakeholders   the promotion of urban gi requires a cross  disciplinary approac h bringing together  researchers in science policy and planning  using indices for specific purposes c ertain pre   considerations for example mckenna  2017  found that a sim ple model can provide realistic  results and that when faced with a range of solutions the simplest is often the most feasible  choice as the parameterization and calculation can be easier accomplished and the  evaluation of results can be more easily shifted to any real  world application  for this reason  ungi is preferred  furthermore using the envisaged parameters  accessibility availability and usage  creates a higher evidence of real world implementation  it facilitates the  interpretation of results and the transferability of gi strategies to other cities within cambodia  and southe ast asia  finally derived results may be more easily combinable with other data  sources i e  heat island maps urban climate maps and so on to nominate ecologically  valuable areas  in general t he ungi approach emphasises the combination and integration  of qualitative results and expert opinions as well as quantitative measurements and  numerical data from surveys and fieldwork  as mentioned before we will change the entry  data set and instead of calculating the ‘normalized difference vegetation index  ndvi  to  detect the land cover class urban vegetation we will process high  resolution imagery  applying a support  vector machine approach a machine learning algorithm that pro vides a  more detailed classification of land cover features  classical classification methods are k   nearest neighbors maximum likelihood classifier minimum distance  to means and  parallelpiped have been investigated and tested in detail in the past  to th e new methods  account machine learning techniques developed to further improve classification results in the field of pixel based classifications  engler 2020    according to engler  2020  is the  support vector machine classifier favourable and has proven to achieve superior  classification results  to assure the data quality for the tr aining and validation data we will  therefore create our own data set using modern measurement instruments  our modified  ungi approach combines remotely sensed information and ground ba sed observation using  an innovative mobile phon e app in combination with unmanned aerial vehicles for spatial  data collection in selected districts of phnom penh during the r&d phase  the s ubsequent  calculation of different parameters leads to insights on the spatial distribution of ugs in the  neighbourhoods and their built  up structures   in this section we will describe our working steps for the modified ungi  gupta et al  2012   and in the next section the citizen science input app approach  within the build4people  project the concept of urban quality of life is a guiding component of t he project purpose  aiming at sustainable urban transformation  for the successful achievement of this objective  buil4people organized research method and approaches for the r&d phase into three  different spheres  in this individual work processes of eac h working group are assigned to  one of those spheres   the first sphere comprises t he societal and scientific problem based  research  the second the transdisciplinary action research and the third the reflection  refinement & re  integration of created knowledge    we list all our main   milestones for each year and under each milestone we will provide  a short description of how we plan to reach the milestones and describe relevant methods and approaches as well as used parameters  the calcula tion of the ungi will help us to determine  areas of high quality urban green zones in the core city and urban fringes of phnom penh and  identify those areas of priority where action to improvements in accordance with our goals  should be implemented   the m ethod seems most suitable as data availability accessibility and indicator  appropriateness for the measurement of an urban green space based quality of urban life indicator are key aspects for the success of the project  furthermore applicability by loca l  agencies will be facilitated with the documentation available within the project from a feasibility standpoint as well as in view of data access needed for the index    the flowchart demonstrates all of our working steps  direct outcomes are recommendation maps indicating critical areas of missing urban green  and missing interlinkages between urban green elements   the applied methodology of the ungi will be documented and used as planning instrument  for administrators and will be integrated into the buld4people toolbox for sustainable  neighbourhoods and development       the ungi help us to conceptualize the concept of green infrastructure and to develop and adapt existing greening strategies together with the phnom penh city hall   year 1   wp4 1 conceptualisation of urban neighbourhood green index  ungi   and  data collection for the ungi  monitoring urban expansion and ugs change is an urgent need for planning and decision   making  sust ainable urban planning requires high resolution and recen t state of the art land  cover or use classification in order to maintain a continuous land use monitoring in phnom  penh  the land cover classification is as a transdisciplinary product as additional to our    uses it as layer to complete the urban cl imate map    will use the improved  classification to calculate a modified version of the urban neighbourhood green index   ungi     in the definition phase   tested and is currently preparing a first land cover classification using a support vector machine  based approach  in the research phase   aims to achieve  further accuracy improvements of the support vector machine based cla ssification using up to  date and comprehensive ground  truthing data by creating training and validation samples  ground based samples will be collected using the mobile phone app ‘input app’   within the  first year we used the app already and evalua ted the collected data and will enhance the data  collection by improving critical features in the research phase  in addition we are aiming to  take multispectral images of the sample points using unmanned aer ial vehicles  uav  in the  research phase  for the training and validation data collection we use a random sample  design distributed over the whole research area  the chosen sample design account s for the  spatial heterogeneity of the area  all research steps are following a detailed documentation of  the spe cific requirements for the data preparation and integration which offers insights into the  open source software qgis based methodology   summary    1  new methods for ground based observation will be tested together with the partner  universities à input app   uav  2  land cover classification will be used from   for ungi calculation and from    for the climate map  3  the index calculation will be based on the latest cloud free multispectral satellite high  resolution images  4  the study area comprises the complete administrative boundaries and urban fringes  of phnom penh  ungi calculation roundtab le workshops and science workshops will be held on the partner  universities to ensure that all resear ch partners have the same level of knowledge  in the first  year the main topic of the workshops will be the presentatio n of the concept of green  infrastructure and ecosystems serv ices linked to the methodical approach from the ungi     data collection the evaluation and preparation of the collected data will take place in the  well equipped university computer labs in cambodia and germany  this deals with  georeferencing of multispectral images of uav and point collection with input’ app   year 2   wp4 2 ungi parameter operationalisation and spatial verification    based on the research outcomes of the first year   team will finalize the land cover  classification and start with the ca lculation of the four main indicators of the ungi to measure  the spatial distribution and quality of green in the urban perimeter of phnom penh    1  amount of green  2  proximity to green  3  density of built  up  4  height of structures   population density  the results of each parameter inherits a classification of urban green in percentage   subsequently the weighting of each indicator determines the importance each parameter    indicator will have within the calculat ion  a pairwise comparison matrix will be developed based  on expert opinion and assigns weight to each indicator  believing ugi forms an integral part  of any urban area and quantity and quality of urban green space is of prime concern for  planners and ci ty administrators  the integration of such stakeholders thus may offer valuable  insights into the prioritization of each of the indicators used for the final ungi calculation  gupta et al  2012    the discussion with phnom penh municipality will be facilitated through  the build4people ecocity transition labs and the sustainable building arena     year 3   wp4 3 analysis and application of ungi for assessing selected  neighbourhoods   with the stakeholder analysis results leading to weighted parameters for the ungi the final  product is able to reveal spatial distribution and qualitative aspects of neighbourhood urban  green areas in phnom penh  these results are used to identify neighbourhoods of priority in  terms of best practice examples as well as areas for specific improvements to be proposed  according to the ecosystem service functionality discussed earlier and in view of spatial  distribution of urban green connectivity   furthermore the gathered da ta from the input  app are analyzed in regard to the b4p uqol  model development    a detailed process guideline documentation will be created for distribution with the rua cidri  and ppca to enable further local applicability on individual terms  training material as well as  informational guides are established so that the methodology for the creation of the ungi in phnom penh can be conducted at any time   year 4   wp4 4 integration of other uqol parameters into ungi   of interest for our research is merschdorf et al   2020  recent study on objective and subjective  data  the main goal of the ir study was to model and understand urban characteristics  and  people perceived quality of urban life  uqol   using statistical analysis and geospatial  modelling  subjective data was also the concern of stessens et al   2020  but instead of trying  to model uqol they concentrate on the modelling of ugs and the perception of its qualities   both studies used a multiple linear regression model to predict the cause and effects from  dependent and independent variables   the emphasis of our model approach is twofold   1  firstly we want to find suitable indicators to successfully predict  perceived  uqol by  using subjective data as dependent variables derived from the uqol household  survey    2  second ly we want to gain insights into the relation between the overall quality of  ugs as perceived by citizens and the way they rate different sub  qualities of ugs   stessens et al  2020    the data derived from the citizen science approach is  described in the following chapter   for b oth research objectives statistical models will be developed in close cooperation between    and      is responsible for the household survey and the overall uqol model  process    has now finalized its spatial quantitative analysis of gi and obtained much objective  information on urban green characteristics  this information will be used and integrated into a  principle component analysis to develop uncorrelated components   the outcome s will serve as independent variable s in a multi ple linear regression analysis  as  previously mentioned t he dependent variable s derive from two different sources  the uqol  household survey and the citizen science project using the input app  all answers will be put  into a gis  based data model  subsequent research will follow the established statistical  relations between objective data  green indicators   deriving from relevant data layers and  describing different ugs characteristics  and subjective data derived from the household  survey of the citizen science project as proposed by the above mentioned authors a  merschdorf et al   2020  and stessens et al   2020    we will also consider the use of a multiple  linear regression model which allows the integration of more than one explanatory variable   the o utcome of this research should lead to a better understanding of the perceived uqol in  phnom penh  from a citizen perspective  and should help us to integrate those results into  urban planning and urban design processes in the future   this chapter gives an introduction to citizen science input app for what   will take the  technical lead to design and develop the data structure for the mobile phone ap p  in the  research phase following

user perception of urban green space in phnom penh    believing that urban green spaces directly affect urban climate biodiversity general human  well being as well as people health   physically socially and mentally of citizens   consequently quality of urb an green space is more perceived as a critical factor for quality of  life in urban areas and a key component of sustainable urban design and planning   input app developed by lutra consulting as open source technology and free of charge  the app for field data collection is a simple survey app allowing users to collect and store object  attribute data during the mobile mapping activity in field  forms and data preparation can be  done in a qgis software environment   inside the build4peopl e project the citize n science input app is a joint activity between  different work packages and in specific from     behaviour change     urban  climate     urban green  and    overall project  coordination    for the elaboration of this application and assuring th e integrity referring to the spatial data  flow and the quality of the software source code and the overall security including privacy  violations of the survey the build4people team will contract lutra consulting limited  a  detailed work description can be found below   main aim using input app –citizen science input app wants to assess the relative  importance residents assign to different qualities of urban green and open spaces in phnom  penh  during the definition phase of the project three main green indicators are identified  including accessibility of green spaces availability of green spaces and the use of green  spaces  now we aim to create an urban green space assessment decomposing green  indicators and users perception of green space into quanti fiable and measurable categories   in doing so the project team strives to establish a simple and easily reproducible overall quality  indicator for urban green space in phnom penh   method build4poeple  wp1  conducts a household survey combining subjective and  objective factors in regard of uqol  based on this survey we will integrate several questions on the topic of urban green space from the questionnaire into spatial data forms in the input  app  using gis solution like input and web forms the build4people project is enabled to  collect store and present the data into a spatial envi ronments and subsequently analy is the  data using geographic software qgis   in order to reach a wide rang e of audience assure data quality through the collection avoid  bias and exhausting data cleaning the project team emphasis is to use a hybrid method  including two methods on data collection  conceptualization of methods refer to the work of  stessens et al 2020 and considers a comprehensive data structure and allows to include  several meaningful quality aspects and attributes of urban green space     method 1 mobile app  input app  –citizen science interviews led by students    use input app to collect info rmation on the citizen subjective perception and assessment on  the quality of urban green spaces   method 1 uses the already existing app infrastructure of the input app and adapts this  according to the specific project needs  for using the input app it is necessary to     users should have some basic knowledge of gis   create a user account with the cloud storage to save the data to   install the app on its mobile device     just then each member can start filling the forms and related information for the purpose of  the survey  while using the app any user can view and edit others participants’ data and  information  this would require a major change in the data security mo del within the app as in  it is current form it could lead to bias in the data and  to work around this problem we will train and introduce students to the use of the input app and have them collect data from  participants  this data collection will be sup ported by the  related local universities mainly  rua and rupp  location of the interviews must be determined as the project progresses e g   public parks in front of malls public spaces  it is emphasized to record about 300 participants   participants  the number for participants is for just an estimation and will be adapted according  to the project needs and prospects  the sample size  participants  can be scaled down up depending on the relative size of your study area      organization of questionnaires    cluster green indicators   quality attributes into thematic main categories and sub  categories     a  select a comprehensive and meaningful set of clearly distinct quality aspects of  b  cluster quality of aspects into larger themes themes still have to be discussed  c  choose

answer of the p articipant   first test  run in the march 2022 exact date tbc    method 2 web forms    use web forms to collect information on the citizen subjective perception and assessment on  the quality of urban green spaces     for method 2 we will use a simple web form with mapping element to collect data  according  to the special needs for the proje ct lutra consulting limited will develop a customized web  application  for the data flow we will follow the main ideas as described above for the overall assessment but instead of using input app we now using the customized web application    same as input app the application uses a plugin for qgis and stores the data into the mergin  server  opposite to input app the web form user interface will be simple and intuitive this is  important by a citizen science project because not everyone is a gis practi tioner   additional to the household survey wp1 will have a linked data   set from participants who  took part in the face  to face interviews and used the web platform as well  the subsequent  data analysis takes place using the open source geographic infor mation software qgis     description of work    1  method 1 will be slimmed down to an attractive short gamified citizen science  based questionnaire  2  customized web application developed by lutra consulting limted for the specific  project needs   3  the participants will get a qr  code with direct link to the web page where they can  fill out the form  optimized for mobile devices  4  the participant indicate if they go by foot or motorbike  5  the participant indicate the nearest publicly accessible green spaces  6  participant s will answer very short questionnaire  7  participant will submit his answer and the a new point is added to the map

investigation of green infrastructure enables the project to reveal  new objectives in supporting the process of building new greening strategies  further the  spatial analysis of urban green infrastructure will facilitate the search for solutions and new ideas to develop and manage green spaces in an urban context  the results of the spatial will  reveal insight on s patial availability distribution and inter  connectivity of urban green on urban  and neighbor hoods level  a citizen science approach will be implemented to assess the  relative importance residents assign to different qualities of urban green and open spaces in  phnom penh  with this data collection the project team is able to collect subjective and  objective data of residents and integrate them those a variabl es into a geo  statistical model   the results will contribute to bridge the gap of analytical scales and scopes between spatial  metrics and individual behavior regarding urban green space structures  the empirical local  investigation spatial research and the inter  and transdisciplinary approach of the project will  produce new knowledge about the nexus of urban green space and structures in a city and  their specific perception and use by the local people  experiences and results will enhance the  academic quality of urban planning and spatial data analytics as well as knowledge of

prepare for implementation phase  green infrastructure and national policies  the promotion of urban green infrastructure requires a cross  disciplinary approach bringing  together researchers in science policy and planning  the parameterization and calculation of  the ungi is straightforward and provides realistic results  each parameter of the ungi is  ranked according to expe rt opinions from administrators and urban planners  derived during  stakeholder workshops and the ecocity transition lab  thus the evaluation of results can be  more easily shifted to any real  world application   this simple model approach is important for     as a successful implementation of the results in phnom penh will result in a blueprint  that can be applied to other cities in cambodia  in relation to this  the urban green module will  be developed as part of the buld4people toolbox for sustainable n eighbourhoods and  development   it contains a set of planning instruments  greening strategies  techniques and  recommendation that support the building a gi strategy and facilitate the search for solutions and new ideas to develop and manage green infrastructure in an urban context   this urban  green module could also be transferred into a elearning module  it will be de signed according  to the needs of urban planners and administrators and its use should prom ote more awareness  of the gi concept  the module is primarily targeted at professional urban based planners who  are seeking further information on the added value and benefits that urban green spaces can  bring to the development of the urban environment  moreover  the module may facilitate the  adaptation of gi to a national level of gi strategies and thus promoting nature based solutions  to preserve natural

mesoscale climate on urban city structures and how much can be mitigated by urban design?  ø how important is thermal comfort for open space use and behavior of people in  phnom penh?  ø how is urbanization related to the urban heat island effec t?  1    insights from the build4people definition phase  phnom penh capital was selected as a study site because of the city is strongly influenced by  high population density and more rapid urbanization  phnom penh is the largest and fastest  growing city in the country and serves as the gateway to the world economy  baker et al   2017   this development of rapid urbanization and economic development ha s transformed  natural landscape s into impervious surfaces that might increase the absorption of solar radia  tion decrease evapotranspiration increase runoff increase surface friction and release anthropogenic heat and these phenomena will influence uhi intensity in phnom penh   phnom penh is located in the contiguous zone of the four rivers tonle sap river tonle bassac  river upper mekong river and lower mekong river  phnom penh has a typical monsoonal  climate with precipitation of about 1493 70 mm per year and average temperature of 29 oc in  2011  yen et al  2017   the maximum temp erature difference during daytime was around 4   5 oc and was less than 2 oc during the night  time  this effect is called urban heat island inten  sity  furuuchi et al  2006    the urban climate is dominated by urban structures which later can be designed fo llowing  climate  conscious recommendations   beside the existing data evaluation  no map or climatological recommendations could be de  rived which is why further research steps are required   the mesoscale conditions in phnom  penh dominate the seasons but in side the city urban structure types orientation of streets  and river influence make considerable changes  therefore it is of main importance to maintain  those streets which serve air ventilation and which mitigate urban heat in some neighbour hoods  in this respect also the thermal induced circulation by the river influence urban climate   the geographical department of rupp gives information about data input by regional and  urban climate stations  they work out statistics so that the urban climate map wi ll get a solid  base  furthermore the competence in measurements with stations as well as mobile ones of our partner has high quality  the combination of measured data and calculations is guaran  teed   2  main aims of the rd  phase  the overall aim of   research work is to identify and evaluate the influence of rapid ur  banization on urban heat island intensity in phnom penh  this has to be linked to the climate  change perspective which can be seen in regional climate analysis  the specific objectives of  this study are as follows  ø methods to evaluate urban climate for areal city development  ø developing tools for climate oriented urban design  ø calibration of thermal comfort indices for open space planning  ø to evaluate the contribution of urbanization effect to uhi and air pollution    2 1  sub  aims    ø  5 1 conducting an urban climate

rural areas with 30 % of the world  population residing in urban areas in 1950 increased to 55 % in 2018  un 2018  and contin ued to increase to 68 % by 2050 according to urban population projec tion  un 2018   the  growth of urban population has led to the expansion of urban areas that have influenced the  urban heat island  uhi  effect  li et al  2018   urbanizing areas are still an attractive place for  more people moving to cities leading to mo re human activities and urban expansion which  create uhi effects  akbari & kolokotsa 2016 kaloustian & diab 2015 mirzaei 2015   urban  ization

noticeable  mirzaei & haghighat 2010 mohajerani et al  2017   with  the rapid urbanization cities are facing more serious climate change challenges especially  the uhi phenomenon  thus proper planning and urban design of cities may improve the ven tilation of street canyon and change the heat balance in the urban canopy and mitigate the uhi  phenomenon  zhao et al  2016    rapid urbanization

the urban atmosphere are considered as atmospheric heat islands whereas the suhi is considered as the relative warmth of urban  surfaces and its surrounding rural areas  oke et al  2017 zhao et a l  2016   many studies of  uhi have shown that urban growth and development caused by urbanization influenced the  uhi effect  for example li et al   2009  stated that the extent and magnitude of uhi was  correlated with a significant increase of the rapid urban expansion while the study of cui & shi   2012  showed that urbanization was correlated with the increase of air temperature and the decrease of relative humidity  in addition the continuous increase of building s paved roads  buses population and gross domestic product  gdp  have driven the growth of uhi   lu et al    2015  revealed that daytime heating effect in the urban area was strongly correlated with ur  ban expansion while the study of weng et al   2004  revealed that spatial variability of lan d  surface temperature  lst  was positively correlated with vegetation abundance   in cambodia rural  urban migration increased from 19 5% in 2008 to 21 4% of total population  in 2013  nis 2013  and predicted to be 22 1% of total population by 2020  unfpa c ambodia  2014   the increase rate of urban population is accompanied by a high urbanization rate re  sulting from increased economic activities migration from rural areas and an influx of foreign  labour  unfpa cambodia 2014   cambodian economic growth rate increased around 7 per cent from 2011 to 2018 which made cambodia the fas test growing country in asia  wb 2019    this resulted in an increase in urban area especially in phnom penh from 3000 ha in 1973 to  4000 ha in 1990 and subsequently increased to 25000 ha in 2015  mialhe et al  2019   the population of phnom penh surge d from 1 85 million in 2012  baker et al  2017  to 2 129 million  in 2019  nis 2019   thus urban expansion and development caused by rapid urbanization  and the increased population in phnom penh may influence the uhi effect       urban climate and the variation of climate change is analyzed citywide for phnom penh  con  ceptional there are three phases integrated in a urban

the definition phase  work package 6     engages in both an analytical and a normative dimension  during  the build4people definition phase  def  phase  our research focused on the analytical  dimension in order to gain insights for the research plan design for the upcoming research  and development phase  rd  phase   this exploratory analysis will be deepend as part of  information through discussions during several workshops organized by   and  conducted a first round of explorative interviews with local stakeholders and experts    a number of challenges in the field of urban development and buildings are frequently  discussed in the cambodia n context   frequently mentioned sector  related problems are the  overburdening of waste water electricity and transport infrastructures  see also baker et  al  2017    a number of policies and initiatives that engage with these deficiencies and  challenges were analysed during the def  phase  too  this includes the work of the global  green growth instit ute  gggi  and its green urban planning methodology  ncsd and  gggi 2016   the phnom penh sustainable city plan 2018  2030  ppca et al  2019  and  the advocacy efforts of the european chamber of commerce  eurocham  among others by means of their annual white books  eurocham 2019   a major problem that has been observed during the def  phase is related to institutional  fragmentation  administrative responsi bilities of sustainable urban development and  sustainable buildings are scattered among many different national  level ministries and  phnom penh city administration  ppca    the ppca has very limited financial and human  resources and is generally considered to be in a relatively weak position between a  the  central state and b  powerful private developers in a disjointed nature of urban governance   paling 2012 p  2895    ppca weak position manifests for example in the non  compliance  with the municipal masterp lan  private developers usually conduct their own planning  relatively independent from ppca  municipal masterplan   additionally projects with more  than 3 000m² receive their buil ding permit from the national level not from the level of the  municipality  project implementation however requires some form of buy  in from the local  elite i e  a project  based and negotiated relationship between private sector developer and  local state actor s  nam 2017a p  626    paling argues that even though the strength and  centrality of the cambodian state in planning and develop ing the city are undeniable its  actual role is much more unclear  as [i]nternal power are shrouded in ambiguity   overlapping with the private business interests of political elites financial enticement for  both individuals and institutions and informal networks of political power  2012 p  2906     the high level of building activity  nam 2017b 2017a world bank group 2019 cbre  2019  and capital investment that were observed during the def  phase resemble  processes of property  led development and have been discussed as a construction boom   brickell et al  2018 p  23  and speculative urbanism  nam 2017a   in a context of  neoliberalism with cambodian characteristics i e  nepoliberalism  springer 2017 p   244  political oligarchy  mialhe et al  2019   illiberal democracy  mccarthy and un  2017  and  neopatrimonial politics  un and so 2011     alternative forms of housing prov ision such as community  driven or non  profit tenure  systems which often have a stronger emphasis on quality of life and sustainability as they are not driven by profit but by the inhabitants and their needs hardly exist in the formal  cambodian context   furthermore several deadlocks were observed during the def  phase   for example a  deadlock with regards to sustainable building materials and practices was detected between  a lack of demand and a lack of supply  in this regard a lack of specialized skills a nd human  resources ha ve been observed as well  besides the market deadlock an institutional  deadlock was observed too private sector driven green building institutionalization  processes – the establishment of a green building council as a ngo – were met by state  opposition  therefore no body such as a cambodian green building council has been officially established yet  in addition most of the interviewees noted that a lack of state regulation and incentives and particularly a lack of enforcement of th e existing regulation  have been holding back potential processes of urban and sectoral transformation   another issue that many interviewees noted was the absence of incentives for sustainable  practices  this could include higher charges or taxes on unsustainable practices and  products or the subsidization of sustainable practices and products or subsidised interest  rates for sustainable building projects all of which do not exist in cambodia yet  there  exists for example no national energy efficiency regulation for the building sector in  cambodia yet  building owners are also not required to obtain obligatory energy certificates  for buildings which would indicate the individual energy performance of a residential unit  and may influence decisions to invest into energy efficiency   also the application of voluntary industry self  regulation initiatives such as green building  certification schemes is very uncommon only seven buildings have received a leed   certification to the present day   july 2020   gbig 2020    none of these are residential  buildings – the most common urban building type and the focus of the build4people project   finally the absence of a platform for connecting and coordinating front runners innovative  sustainability minded actors within and beyond the sector was mentioned by several  interviewees as a constraining factor  such spaces are considered of importance for the co   development of knowledge capabilities social capital alter native discourses and policy  alternatives   particularly in illiberal contexts  noboa and upham 2018     a number of these actors articulated interest in academic support and transdisciplinary  cooperation towards transformative change  the def  phase thus showed that  sustainability  minded actors do exist in the local context but that they are rather isolated  and in a relatively marginalized position     this marginalization and the socio  political and institutional barriers described above can  be connected to the literature on governance for transition which argues that  urban   sustainability transitions are not primarily challenged by the need for technological innovations but innovations in the field of governance and institutions  rohracher 2001 rink et al  2018    this highlights the relevance of   and its guiding research question  of how to identify adapt and implement governance approaches that can support an urban  transformation in phnom penh while also increasing the quality o f urban life  based on the  literature review and a first analysis of the local context we thus argue that in order to  support a sustainable urban transformation in phnom penh the application of a  transformative governance approach would be promising that    supports networking coalition building the visibility of front  runners   integrates experimental and transdisciplinary elements   supports innovation  particularly socio  institutional and socio  political     such an approach woul d address the observed marginalization of niche actors and  sustainibility minded regime actors from various actor groups  incl  industry state academia  and civil society   socio  institutional and socio  political innovations that might result of this  support could then strengthen developments towards an urban sustainability transition in  phnom penh        main goal  to co develop and implement a transformative and collaborative governance approach  with local stakeholders that is tailored to the local context of phnom penh in order to  support processes of transformative urban and sectoral change in the building sector  towards sustainability and a better urban quality of life     sub goals of the rd phase  ø in depth understanding of local transition dynamics the socio  techno  political  system of cambodia building sector and phnom penh urban development regime and ongoing transformative processes  year 1   ø participatory problem framing & development of a shared vision  year 2   ø development of an urban transition agenda  year 3   ø facilitation and analysis of transformative experiments  year 4     the complex interdependencies and internal contradictions the absence of unambiguous  „right or „wrong solutions long  term investments and long life spans make urban   un sustainability as encountered in phnom penh a „wicked problem according to ernst et  al   2016    scholars argue that such wicked problems as evident in phnom penh current  urban development path and the building sector practices are bes t addressed by  transformational sustainability research  frantzeskaki et al  2012 ernst et al  2016 rink  et al  2018    transformational sustainability research aims to develop solution options for  sustainability problems and eventually to transform the status quo towards sustainability   wiek and lang 2016 p  38     based on a n extensive review of the literature on sustainability transitions and sustainable  urban transformations a range of different but related approaches were identified that exist  to teer' in the midst of uncertainty  frantzeskaki et al  2018a p  20  and to support  incremental steps for change towards urban sustainability 1 most of the transformational  research approaches highlight the need of experimentation and policy learning to initiate  transformative change  wiek and lang 2016 raven et al  2019 sengers et al  2019  engler et al  2019    in fact experimentation is considered a key concept for the  governance of sustainability transitions  wirth et al  2019 p  229    here experiments are  defined as „inclusive practice  based and challenge  led initiative s designed to promote  system innovation through social learning under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity   raven et al  2019 p  260    most of the studies in the field of urban sustainability transitions  also draw on the concept of transdisciplinarity  this involves the inclusion of a variety of  actors in the research process  incl  academia and non  academia stakeholders of  government business civil society  through community  based interactive or participatory  approaches  wiek and lang 2016    it is argued that a successful transformation requires  input from all communities of knowledge and their respective epistemics  as the research  aims to reach beyond analysis and actually lead to implementation the role of non   academics or practitioners is crucial  this then also enables higher ownership and legitimacy of the transition process  lang et al  2012 p  26    to design the most suitable  research approach for   r&d phase  a number of epistemological and ontological  questions are to be considered     1 these transition processes are purposive transition according to the classification of smith et al   2005 p    the literature review has identified a wide range of research approaches that aim to analyse  and support transformative change towards s ustainability   this includes approaches that  centre niches  as protected spaces for innovation and their support as strategic niche  management  schot and geels 2008 kemp et al  1998   encompassing concept s of  transition management  tm  that connect long  term thinking with short term steps within a  reflexive and partici pative governance framework th at involves participatory forms of  envisioning negotiating experimenting and learning  loorbach 2010 frantzeskaki et al   2018b   approaches that focus on the backcasting element of transition management   robi nson et al  2011 wieners et al  2015   or approaches that extend the transition  managenemt concept to illiberal democratic contexts in transdisciplinary transition  management arenas  noboa and upham 2018   and those concepts that highlight the  collaborative ge neration of knowledge for transitions  preller et al  2014    furthermore  scholars have combined and applied these and other transformational methodologies in the  tansform  framework  wiek and lang 2016   or forms of experimental labs such as t  labs  pathways network 2018   urban transition labs  nevens et al  2013   urban living  labs  voytenko et al  2016 bulkeley et al  2015   or real world laboratories  schäpke et  al  2018    most of these approaches apply the conceptual tool of the multi  level perspective  mlp  on  transitions  geels 2005 2014    according to the mlp transitions are fundamental changes  of socio  technical or socio  political  swilling et al  2016  regimes that have dev eloped  around key technologies or sectors such as the building industry  loorbach et al  2017     the transition i tself is understood as the result of dynamics between  a  the regime  b   external pressures  i e  landscape pressures  and  c  emerging and innovative niches   loorbach et al  2017     a common theme of these transformational approaches is furthermore a series of  intervention phases  from here on transition management phases    see for example  loorbach 2010 p  173  these commonly include a first phase of in depth analysis and the  development of a shared problem understanding or framing  strategic phase   in a second  phase then having establishment a platform or arena multi  stakeholder collaboration and  the development of a transition agenda becomes crucial  thirdly the operationalisation of  both vision and agenda in experiments and projects takes centre stage   these three are  complemented by a reflective phase in some cases  wittmayer et al  2018 loorbach 2010     the multiplicity of transformational governance approaches highlights the shift from an analysis of the governance of transitions to gove rnance for transitions    b4p follows this change and aims to develop a transition approach that allows to both  analyse and actively support transformative change towards urban sustainability in phnom  penh   2  governance for transitions  initially not much attention was paid to questions of power agency politics and governance  within sustainability transition studies  bulkeley et al  2015    an early intervention in the  debate however came from smith et al   2005  who argues that system  level change is by  definition enacted through the coordination and steering of many actors and resources  whether these are intended or emergent features of transformation processes  smith et al   2005 p  1492   subsequently a number of studies have dealt with the governance of and for urban transitions focusing on questions such as  a  the extent to which actors are  in   capable of drawing upon and mobilizing  different resources  b  whether they reproduce challenge or develop alternate institutions  c  the capacity of creative  or innovative  power of niche practices  d  and the extent of  democratic  legitimacy and politics of systemic change   bulkeley et al  2015 p  9     there are then significant moves within the field to recognise the importance of governance  power and politics to the development of niches the constitution of regimes and the  formation of socio  technical transitions  questions of power are particularly recurring     while d iffering understandings of power exist within the transition literature  one of the most  encompassing understanding s has been developed by avelino  2017 see also avelino and  wittmayer 2016 avelino and grin 2017 avelino et al  2016 avelino 2009    she defines  power as the  in capacity of actors to m obilize resources to achieve a goal  avelino 2017  p  515    avelino argues that with power being understood as a capacity its analysis should  focus on the exercise of power  therefore she has developed a framework that  distinguishes different levels and ways in which actors are mobilising resources  her power  in transition framework  point  indicates innovative transformative destructive reinforcive  transformati ve and systemic ways of exercising power   bulkeley et al   2015  claim that the key current dilemma within the transition studies  research community is how to marry a concern with th e power of agents  derived in large  part from the concern to identify where the capacity for transformative change might come from  with a recognition of the distributed or relation nature of power  bulkeley et al  2015  pp  12– 13   the authors caution that a focus on power as attached to one actor neglects the  regime structurin g power while human  centred understandings neglect the more  than  human and socio  material means of power co  constitution  bulkeley et al  2015    therefore they propose the development of relational power conceptualizations that understands  power as a distributed property such that it neither resides with individual agents nor is  structurally determined  bulkeley et al  2015 p  14    referring to both foucault  governmentality framework and neo  gramscian understandings of hegemony  they highlight  the dispersed nature of rule  they thus consider purposive transition initiatives as strategic projects and focus on the dynamic qualities of power as a set of capacities that are constituted through the formation of strategic projects d esigned to intervene in the city in  relation to particular goals which have some degree of authority and legitimacy  bulkeley et  al  2015 p  14   questions of power an d its distribution will thus be important considerations  for   research activities and the final design of its action research processes    moving to the scale of the individual h ousehold  questions of intra  household power  dynamics are also highly relevant  this relates to the  re configuration of the household as  a political terrain  where not only questions of sustainable resource use but also other socio   political questions of urban development such as segregation or a just distribution of infrastructure costs are fought out   rohracher and köhler 2019 p  2375    in her recent  study on the cambodian home katherine brickell has highlighted the gendered dimension of household decision  making domestic violence and insecurity and calls for an  understanding of the domestic sphere as a critical yet overlooked vantage point for  understanding the trajectory of cambodia  2020 p  1     will therefore support    in their considerations of these everyday life household decision making processes and  social practices of households in the analysis of possible transition pathways and their barriers and triggers  the t ransdisciplinary uqol process lead by   will regard the  gender perspective in respect of how people perceive and interact with the urban  environment  as fadda  2003  suggests the concept of uqol needs to be understood as a  social construct which is in relation with gender and the environment we aim to be sensitive  to the gender aspect within our research   3  spatiality of transitions i urban transitions  researchers have recently also started to consider the s patiality or geography of transition  dynamics  truffer et al  2015 hansen and coenen 2015    in this regard space specific  factors such as localized  informal   institutions and networks particular consumer demands  etc  and spatial variations of regime formations that lead to place  specific transition  processes have been discussed  köhler et al  2019 van welie et al  2018 fastenrath and  braun 2018    within this line of research the analysis of urban transformations  or urban  sustainability transitions has assumed a prominent role  urban transformations are  considered to b e multi  level and multi  scalar i e  span across governance levels levels of  the multi  level perspective and across spatial scales  späth and rohracher 2012 nevens et al  2013    wolfram et al   2016  distinguish three different standpoints on the engagement  with urban transformations claiming that some studies aim at a  system change or new  systemic configurations b  urban change or new urban configurations or c  urban system relations  while all of these come with their own insufficiencies their combined use i s  considered a rich epistemological spectrum by wolfram et al   2016 p  20   when  considering urban sustainability transitions in cambodia building sector contradictions or  alignments between socio  technical regimes and their priorities and those of urban or  territorial systems must thus be considered  it is to be ask ed to which extent the territorial  priorities of an urban governance network – and the social interests that produce them – are  able to actively manage socio  technical regime change  hodson and marvin 2010 p  481     in this regard the multi  level governance perspective is of utmost importance  ehnert et al   2018    therefore   brings together the literature on sustainability transitions their  geography and urban governance to analyse and support the context  specific processes of  sustainable urban transformation i n phnom penh building sector     4  spatiality of transitions ii transitions in the global south  with most of the transformational research being rooted fi rmly in the global north few  applications of the concepts have b een applied in the global south – none were found for  the cambodian context  authors have discussed differing degrees of regime  in stability  in the global south  hansen et al   2018  and wieczorek  2018  argue that both regime  instability and diversity are higher in the global south  noboa et al   2018  however claim  that state capture oligopolies authoritarianism etc  are increasing the stability of the status quo in many contexts of the global south  another question is the relation between formal  and informal institutions   here many scholars argue that informal institutions have a much  larger influence on regimes and transitional processes than in the global north  feola  2019   posits that these informal institutions tend to be informed by traditiona l principles and  ontologies  scholars furthermore question whether states can play an active role in  supporting socio  technical niches or similar transition initiatives in contexts with a prevailing  focus on short  term development objectives and curtailed state ca pabilities of enforcing rules  and providing public services  hamann and april 2013    other authors deal with the implicit  assumptions that the western  developed ideas of transition re search entails  these  include the prevalence of market mechanisms particular governance arrangements and the  greater good  feola 2019 kenis et al  2016       considerations of a just transition have also emerged in the discourse on transitions in the  global south  this includes questions on equity and justice and trade  offs between different  groups of current and future generations  newell and mulvaney 2013 swilling et al  2016 onsongo and schot cai 2019    swilling et al   2016 p  650  argue that a just transition  would involve the dual commitment to human well  being  with respect to income education  and health  and sustainability  with respect to decarbonisation resource efficiency and  ecosystem restoration   other factors affecting the decision  making process are also  debated in this stream of literature  it is ar gued that a number of factors are playing a more  significant role in global south contexts this includes differing value priorities and other power relations such as ethnicity that exist alongside – partly in contradictory manner – to  those logics of prof it maximisation and competitiveness  2 another peculiar aspect to be  considered when dealing with transition  inspired initiatives in the global south are the  particular conditions of postcoloniality  pereira et al  2020    sustainability transition projects  have been commonly associated with developmentalist interventions  as many governments in the global south – influence d by scholarly critics of capitalist and mostly  northern development models – have initiated development in their own terms non   reflective transition initiatives in the global south risk the reproduction of western ideals of progress and modernity and mi ght be perceived as a new form of colonisation   feola  2019 p  5    the build4people team will t hus practice this reflectivity and consider their own positionality  during the research process  the insights from the emerging literature on transitions in the global south will be important for the analysis of possible transition pathways barriers and  drivers in the context of phnom penh and the conceptualizat ion of regimes niches and the  distribution of power   5  socio  technical considerations of the building and urban development sector   besides its bias towards the global north  the transition literature also has a sectoral bias  towards energy and mobility  others such as the building sector have seen less scholarly  interest despite their significant environmental impacts  fastenrath and braun 2018  affolderbach and schulz 2018    in fact green  or sustainable  buildings can arguably be  identified as one of the most significant cheapest and fastest approaches to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions at the local scale  preller et al  2017 pp  217– 218 oecd and  iea 2013 unep and global abc 2016       meanwhile t he challenge of a sustainability transition of the building sector is not primarily  considered to be a question of better technological solutions instead it is argued that much  more challenging is the social embedding and the socially interactive process of designing  constructing and using build ings  rohracher 2001 p  139    according to rohracher [t]he  way we construct buildings and the way we live in buildings are deeply intertwined with the way we organize our social world and its interaction with nature  2001 p  137     transformative strategies therefore rely on an understanding of household behaviour and  consumption within the context of the built environment  mccormick et al  2013 p  5    this  will be addressed by collaborative research efforts of     and   and the  transdisciplinary action rese arch   the construction industry is conventionally considered to have low degrees of innovation  and mass production while being shaped by high levels of labour intensity and regionalism and a separation of design and construction  rohracher 2001    a green building or  sustainable building sector in contrast has to integrate high  tech components  requires  specialized companies including different services and consultancy firms  therefore new  forms of intense cooperation between specializ ed actors have to emerge   this also includes  the creation of new firms and the reorientation of existing ones  moreover an overall  increase of innovation dynamics is to be expected  green or sustainable buildings commonly  lay at the intersection of multip le sectoral policy fields including climate policy energy and  environmental policy and economic and regional policies  this further complicates a  transition in contexts such as cambodia where disjointed governance can be observed   besides building materia ls energy usage etc  sustainable building aspects can include  flexibility of usage organisation of buildings and their design and planning processes land use planning  dgnb no date    næss and vogel argue that new technologies in the building  sector will coexist over much longer periods than in other  h istorical  cases of transitions   2012     the review of the literature on transitions in the building sector highlights the sector  specific  features that will be considered for the research process  due consideration of these is  crucial for the design of the action research and the development of promising transition  strategies  of particular relevance is here the need for new forms of cooperation that are  required in the development process towards a sustainable building sector     the research design of   follows the build 4people structure and thus focuses on  societal and scientific based pro blem research in the first year before turning towards  transdisciplinary action research processes in the second and third year and finally moving  towards the refinement of theory in y ear 4  based on the literature review and the insights  from the definition phase    will draw on the work on collaborative governanc e  including    urban transition labs – an adaptation of transition management to the urban realm   nevens et al  2013      transdisciplinar y transition

organizations  hodson and marvin  2010     building upon this assemblage of frameworks  pereira et al  2020 p  175    engages  with the knowledge co  production in the policy  science interface for

and exploring local dynamics  frantzeskaki  et al  2018c silvestri et al  2018    here   and   and their local partn ers will start  the sba process by assembling a transition team  this will comprise   its partners  and local stakeholders that fully support the idea of transformationa l change towards urban  sustainability 3    ii  sba process  2022  2024    building upon the extended knowledge basis that includes a substantial multi  level  stakeholder mapping the transition team – led by   – will then establish the sba  process and prepare the first sba event  a fundamental task at this point is the design of  the sba as a governance niche i e  a safe r space where participants  i e  change agents  can discuss and co  design ideas problems strategies and actions without immediate  ‘control’ of regime actors that may have dominantly business  as usual conceptions   nevens et al  2013 p  117    the sba process involves a set of workshops   these  workshops will be connected to build4people conferences to make use of synergies and  maximize participation of both local stakeholders and the build4people team  this will  furthermore open the possibility for sba side events that can be initiated by stakeholders  and other wps  the sba will furthermore be established as a communication  dissemination and collaboration platform  the sba process thus fulfils three functions a   the workshop series b  a governance nic he and c  a communication dissemination and  networking platform  sba functions will be closely integrated with the work of other wps  and other transdisciplinary research activities particularly the build4people ecocity  transition lab     led  and the technological consultations and roadmap development  processes led by     outcomes of the different activities are directly fed into the design  of subsequent activities     as proposed in figure 2 and figure 3 the sba includes two cycles of the first three  transition management phases  milestones sba1 & sba2    in the first cycle a key role is  given to so  called front runners who are understood as  visionary people […] that are able  and willing to engage in a creative process of out  of the box thinking with regards to a  desirable long  term future for a sustainable city  cf  the urban sustainability time  scale  challenge  [and can be both] out  of regime pioneers but also change  inclined regime  agents  nevens et al  2013 p  119    they are thus considered to be part of the sba    3 this could involve interested wps and their local partners key administrative people like vannak seng   ppca  nokhai sop  ncsd  progressive local architectural offices  urban living solutions archetype niron  housing kongny hav etc   socially innova tive institutions such as the impact hub phnom penh cks cdri  process rather as individuals with an intrinsic motivation than as representatives of their  respective institution and are expected to „work autonomousl y or ’protected‘ from the  regime in mutual trust and at an initially low visibility for the outside world  nevens et al   2013 p  120    the first phase of the workshop cycle  sba  p1  see figure 3  aims at the development of  a participatory framing of the transition challenge  interactive transdisciplinary  knowledge generation and interaction between researchers and stakeholders gener ates  new and differentiated knowledge at this point that benefits both researchers and  stakeholders cross  fertilizes stimulates self  reflection and connects theoretical discourses  and practitioners and thus supports a sustainability transition  preller et al  2014    sba  p1  starts with brief inputs from the wps that are based on their research findings   in this  transdisciplinary action research phase t he sba participants will then co  develop a framing  of the transition challenge based on the inputs and their rich experience and thus extend  the expert  led analys is of the previous phase that focused on societal and scientific  probnlem based reserach   the second phase sba  p2 will then focus on the devcelopment of a common vision for  phnom penhs building sector and the built environment  here sba  participants shall co  develop and express their key priorities and principles for their envisioned future spatio   sectoral system as well as images and narratives of the future  this process can contribute  to the alignment of perspectives and a positive group dynamics  im portant aspects are the  internalisation of the narratives and the diffusion of narratives and visions beyond sba  the internalisation should then not only include the vision itself but also the awareness of the necessity for fundamental change as well as its understanding as an experimental and  open  ended processes   in the third phase sba  p3 backcasting methodologies will be applied to connect the future  scenarios and narratives to the present in order to develop concrete transition pathways  and strateg ies  hereby a first draft version of a transition agenda will be established   at this point the role of the transition team moves to the background as sba  p3 aims at a  number of emerging self  organizational processes  nevens et al  2013 p  120     a second cycle of the three transition maangement phases will then be imlemented in  the subsequent year  here the results of the first cycle will be validated and new research  results of the other wps will be i nfused  in the second cycle the front  runners will be joint  by a wider group of participants  based on the updates of the challenge framing  sba  p1   and vision  sba  p2  the participants will co  develop an encompassing transition agenda  document  this pro cess shall then also integrate the research results of the other wps  neighbourhood plans & guidelines that will have been developed within the ecocity  transition lab process led by   and the results of the technological roadmap  development of     the fourth workshop phase  sba  p4  which will be implemented in the fourth year then  aims at the initiation of real  life experiments that are based on the previous steps of problem  analysis vision and agenda development   this requires even more autonomy a nd active  engagement of the sba  participants and their wider networks  experiments should come  with new forms of collaboration between actors  besides the experiments that are expected to be emerging during the previous phase   and   will propose a number of  experiments to be discussed within sba that are based on the literature and previous  findings of   and the other wps   this includes the facilitation of a green & smart  campus for the cambodian development research institute 4 the development of a  sustainable building webtool the implementation of constructive technology  assessments and co development of innovative green building finance mechanisms  the  implementation of the proposed experiments will be based on the discussio n with local  partners the transition team and sba  these experiments shall be engaging with already  ongoing initiatives that have been analysed during the pre  sba phase in an appreciative  enquiry  nevens et al  2013 p  119      the sba will be complemented by a    led sustainable building incubator   sbi   it  complements the sba process with knowledge co  production and strategic niche  management activities at the science  business interface  the sbi will be implemented  between the two sba cycles in order to channel insights from the science  policy inter face  i e  the first sba cycle to the science  business interface of the sbi and to then feed the  insights of the sbi back to the second sba in order to co  develop a comprehensive  transition agenda     4 the cambodian development resource institute is one of the key private research institutes and think tanks  in cambodia  being committed to transformative change towards sustainability the cdri has declared their  interest in the development of a green & smart campus for cdri as a b4p pilot project  the support of this  iii  the sustainable building incubator the sbi is planned in cooperation with impact hub phnom penh a local change leader  and social venture and enterprise builder  the program intention is to support early s tage  entrepreneurs in sustainable buildings to improve their entrepreneurial way of thinking and  to support their innovation process  many early s tage entrepreneurs in cambodia struggle  to trans ition into fully functioning smes and mmes  and by running this program  and providing tailored immersive support we hope that more innovative  sustainable businesses emerge that support the transition of the building and urban  development sectors in phnom penh as part of a sustainable urban transformation  the  participants will be equipped with the network soft skills and business acumen and  mindset to launch and grow a startup related to the sustainable building industry  through  online promotion of the startups and their goals the sbi can inspire the next  generation of entrepreneurs and changemakers to start their own initiatives   the sbi  furthermore provides deeper insights into the sustainable building startup sector through  thorough and valuable data collection and impact measurement  the sbi processes and  outcomes can be conceptualized and analysed from a multi level perspective on  transitions as innovation proces ses in relatively protected spaces i e  niches and as  strategic niche management  schot and geels 2008

cambodia in order to  gain a deeper understanding of their industry and its challenges and opportunities   the masterclasses within the structured group learning sessio ns allow for input of different  b4p work packages  the expertise and preliminary research findings of the other wps as  well as the results of the participatory challenge framing workshop can be channelled into  these classes  the masterclasses will be com plemented by an ihpp  led innovation  bootcamp  partners of the b4p network can additionally assume mentorship positions and  offer field trips  the overall design of the final sbi will be co  developed by ihpp and  #6  of b4p to reflect latest insights from the academic literature previous b4p research results  and the local experience in incubator facilitation  iphh   an extended sbi  > 20000 euro   might be implemented in case of third party funding from industry partners  iphh has  reported interest from the private sector in funding additional sbi elements including seed  financing for start  ups that are to be incubated within the sbi process   the sbi will be integrated into the sba process that applies the transition management literature to the local context  the integration of the sbi into the sba and the co  facilitation  of sba and sbi by the b4p  impact hub  team yields significant synergies  to maximize the  cross  fertilization of the academia  policy interface  sba  and the academia  business  interface  sbi  the sbi will be implemented between the two sba cycles  see figure 3       iv  overall principles of the process and beyond  whereas other projects dealing with u rban sustainability transitions frame the important  processes of reflection monitoring evaluating and learning  rmel  as a separate  phase build4people proposes to understand these as ongoing processes  i e  feedback  loops   this shall include ex ante interviews before the workshop cycles participant  observations during the arena workshops and post  hoc questionnaire after the sessions   see figure 3   this procedure allows to gather insights into  a  the process  b  the  generated actionable knowledge and  c  information about future applications of the methodology  noboa 2019a    the reflexive process will thus also inform the  conceptualization of the second cycle of the sba sba  p4 and future applications in the  subsequent imple mentation phase and beyond  see also figure 3     the facilitation of the sba and the sbi allows   to critically analyse the development of a collabor ative and supposedly transformative governance approach  it will allow the  team to gain insights into the applicability and adaptability of the urban sustainability transition and transformation frameworks that have been developed in the global north  the analysis shall then allow the team to refine the theory on urban sustainability transition  and guide future interventions in the implementation phase and beyond   the sba and sbi process es are complemented by  engaging & anchoring  e&a   activities   these e&a activities shall support the integration and connection of sba sbi  and the wider b4p project to ongoing initiatives processes of policy formulation and wider  networks  of particular importance are the integration into the ncsd  led t echnical working  groups  twg  and its policy development process as well as to the work of

manageable risks  that are primarily related to the global covid  19 pandemic  in a scenario of ongoing travel  restrictions   will be able to conduct most of its research and implementation activities  digitally and via its local partner s at least during the phase of societal and scientific problem   based research  having established a solid cooperation structure and research framework little other risks are foreseen  the experimental operataionalization of th e transition agenda  in year four comes naturally with the risk of partial failure  this is however part of the  transdisciplinary and experimental research process and incorporated in the research framework   economic success prospects  the    led transdis ciplinary build4people sustainable building incubator aims at the  support of impact  oriented early  stage entrepreneurs in the building and urban development  sector  the sbi is thus expected to lead to a number of sustainability oriented startups that might yield economic and socio  environmental benefits  here are also opportunities to  promote the market  entry of german companies globally leading in this field  the  development of sustainability oriented startups is however highly dependent on external  seed  funding for the first round of financing after the end of the sbi   scientific success prospects  the research plan of   allows the team to significantly extend the literature on urban sustainability transiti ons a highly active and relevant field of research with increasing  importance   the application and adaptation of such frameworks in the global south and the  particular setting of cambodia is highly relevant for the transdisciplinary research  community and its underlying goal of addressing scientific and societal

activities during rd  phase contribute to  transdisciplinarity    facilitates two transdisciplinary processes during the r&d phase namely the  build4people sustainable building arena  sba  and the build4people sustainable building  incubator  sbi   within these processes   will call for the transdisciplinary integration  of research activities and findings of the other wps  most prominently this will include the  integration of reseach results at the kick  off of both the sba and the sbi  in both cases the  research findings shall be discussed b y the participants at the respective workshop and  integrated and further discussed in the context of their challenge framing  this particulalry  calls for the integration and discussion of the build4people ecocity transition lab results   led by    and the technical consultations  technological roadmap development   led  by     the results of the sba & sbi will then however inform the processes of the other  wps including an updated technological roadmap subsequent ecocity transition labs and  the develo pment of the build4people toolbox   furthermore the sba and sbi process shall  lead to the facilitation of experiments in the fourth years  these experiments will be transdisciplinary by nature and involve the input from other wps based on the nature of the  respective experiment   finally it has to mentioned that   will support the modelling process of urban quality  of life with conceptual input on the urban sustainability  liveability nexus and with  perspectives on questions of urban governance     based on its research activities during the first year that aim at a better system  understanding   will facilitate its action research activities in the subsequent years as  described above  these will involve the co  generation of actionable knowledge  and a  transition agenda  and its application in experiments  the anal ysis of these experiments  during the fourth year will then pave the way to refined applications of the co  produced  knowledge and possibly the mainstreaming of succesful experiments funded e g  by doner  organisations during the build4people implementation p hase      person months
