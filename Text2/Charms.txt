heritage buildings as part of urban regions into a modern and energy efficient society  charms  develops an integrated urban development strat egy for improving the th ermal comfort of historic houses and  neighborhoods in the urban region of chiang mai  in the light of the planning paradigm of preservation through use locally adapted sustainable usage concepts for historic wooden houses are developed and their implementation prepared  first climate models of  various urban climatic levels are developed  the climate analysis is enriched with the comparative analysis of the attitudes of urban and rural residents of historic districts on the subject of energy and resource efficient building renovation  the ecological and social effectiveness of the solution s developed in the project is assesse d based on these climate and social structure models  the developmen t of locally adapted solutions is ba sed on innovation challenges understood as short solution oriented experimental projects that propose solutions from the perspective of building materials the building structure the urban microclimate the municipal communication infrastructure and the standardization of municipal decision  making processes  this process is accompanied by the asean wide identification of social innovations to improve thermal comfort as well as the asean wide im plementation of capacity development activities with universities f rom countries confronted with comparable challenges  the technical and social innovations are presented to an expert and to a community advisory board and adjusted accordin g to their feedback  the focus of the  last two project years is the political and scientific utilization of the project results and the preparation of the economically viable implementation of the integrated urban development strategy in thesubsequent implementation phase ba sed on an innovation strategy  charms c ontributes to the implementation of the green economy future city  german energiewende and links e cology with economy and social aspects  charms operationalizes the national sustainability strategy  new edition 2016  and the german high tech strategy  the project also makes a contribution to theimplementation of the goals for sustainable development of the united nations  sdgs  especially goal 7  energy for all  goal 11  sustainable cities  and goal 17  global partnership for sust ainable development  2  problem analys is focal problem unhealth y and uncomfortable thermal environments provided by traditional wooden buildings in thailand impair local resident wellbeing research conducted by the charms team in 2019 shows that the use value that residents in chiang mai northern thailand attribute to wooden traditional residential buildings is impaired by the unsatisfac tory indoor comf ort these buildings provide  this problem is further evidenced by a convenience sa mple based pilot survey  with 119 respondents from the pilot districts of wat lam chang and wat ket conducted in 2020  thereof 52 residents of wooden buildings   with future developments in mind it is important to note that the results indicate a generation split in terms of perceptions of the indoor comfort provided by traditional wooden building with the younger generation having a more negative view on this issue than the older generation  fig 1   at the same time the results indicate that the existence and future use of these buildings are of utmostimportance for the sake of the cultural identity of the local inhabitants  with almost 80 percent approval amongthose respondents who do not live in traditional wooden buildings  additional qualitative interv iews with stakeholders indicate that thermal comfort understood as a condition  of mind that expresses the subjective satisfaction with the thermal environment  kolokotsa et al  2012  is  the mos t important determinant of the cost effective provision of an acceptable level of indoor c omfort for  local residents  as a result the current performance of traditional wooden buildings in chiang mai do not  meet the expectations of most residents  those living in wooden buildings feel impaired by an either energy   costly  with air conditioning  or for many uncomfortable  without air conditioning  thermal environment   managing the indoor climate of traditional wooden buildings is not only a question of thermal comfort but  also a health is sue  air pollution in chiang mai has increased enormously compared to the times when the  traditional wooden buildings were built having led to the problem of haze pollution especially during the dry  season  january to april  when dust remains suspended in the atmosphere for a long time  chiang mai was  ranked as having the worst air quality index sc ore in the world in march 2019  sereenonchai et al 2020   as  a res ult of uncomfortable and unhealthy indoor conditions the majority of chiang mai city historic residential  buildings that are older than 80 years have been replaced by modern apartment buildings resulting in a  dwindling feeling of cultural identity and a dec reasing quality of life not only for the residents  but for the  entire neighborhood  furthermore this urban dev elopment comes with a high level of resource consumption   due to mechanical ventilation and cooling  thailand final energy consumption has been continuously  increasing in the building sector accounting for 57 9% of total electric ity consumption in 2013   chaichaloempreecha et al  2017   the covid19 outbreak is adding to the relevance of a comfortable and  healthy indoor environment in residential buildings s ince working from home has become the new normal   cause analysis identifying levers for change towards the reconciliation of energy savings thermal  comfort optimization and heritage values  the joint decision of the thai german team to focus r&d activities on addressing the problem of  uncomfortable and unhealthy traditional wooden residential buildings in chiang mai guided a deeper cause  cause 1 changing social demands on thermal comfort as thailand economy is on the rise individual  demands for thermal comfort are increasing  respondents of the survey in the pilot districts indicate that the  inadequacy of thermal comfort partly results in the inability of wooden buildings to meet the expectations of  modern living  in qualitative interviews conducted in 2019 interviewees related the term modern to changes  in the functional use of residential buildings compared to the past an increasing individualization in the thai society resulting in individually differentiated and over all increasing  thermal  comfort expectations as well  as increasing awareness for the impact of indoor climate conditions on the physical wellbeing of residents   cause 2 misfit of traditional cooling systems and urban climate chiang mai architecture has to  accommodate three seasons the rainy season from may to october  average temperatures of 28°c and 80% humidity  the dry season from november to february  average temperatures of 23°c  and the hot  season from february to april may  daytime temperatures above 40°c   the most effective adaption of  traditional houses to the hot and humid climate in chiang mai was the use of raised floors and a loose fit  alignment of wooden beams for floors and walls to allow wind to pass through the building  shimizu 2018    however inthailand today it is a challenge to rely on natural ventilation as a passive cooling system in urban  areas  tantasavasdi et al 2011  as the constantly changing environment has significant effects on the wind  pattern air pollution and disturbing noise on top of the noticeable increase in overall temperatures due to the onset of climate change  remote sensing images reveal that rapid urbanization causes urban heat islands in  chiang mai  srivanit and hokao 2012    cause 3 investment decisions favoring active cooling qualitative interviews conducted in 2019 with  residents in the pilot districts of wat lam chang and wat ket indicate that ac is considered the most effective means for cooling indoor space  a residential building without a central cooling system needs several ac systems to be able to cool the entire living area  as the economic burden to install a cooling system lies on  the individual household it is causing heat inequiti es between richer and poorer segments of society  this  effect is further enhanced as the exhaust air from ac contributes to the urban heat island effect and therefore fostered by the spread of modern building practices in chiang mai and faith in modern technical solutions in particular energy intensive air condition to achieve i ndoor comfort  extra measures for improving the building  envelope such as internal wall insulation air tigh tening and other technical improvements or traditional  passive systems that would save both energy and financia l resources in the long run are rarely considered   cause 4 lack of collective efficiency of urban development initiatives collaborative efforts of private  sector governmental civil society and academic actors are at the center of promoting attractive and  sustainable urban development  over the course of th e last two years the charms team identified  numerous initiatives such as sparc living city learning space or the establishment of the social  enterprise chiang mai city development co  ltd  there is much talk of chiang mai becoming a unesco city or a creative city and the thai digital economy promotion agency promotes the transformation to  chiang mai smart city  in chiang mai the collective efficiency of these initiatives however remains limited  as stated by one interviewee we are left wondering why basic problems such as the annual air pollution  and transportation issues aren’t being tackled let alone solv ed  from a sociological perspective this problem  stems from the fact that progress towards smarter and more sustainable cities cannot only be about resource  and energy efficient built environments and technical infr astructure  it stems from overcoming the lack of  willingness and ability to cooperate in transdisciplinary app lied r&d projects as transdisciplinary research  questions and methodologies are often not eligible for acknowledged science funds the rareness of  transdisciplinary chairs and professorships in southeast asia and the fact that a transdisciplinary record of  accomplishment of local academics is usually not sufficient when applying for disciplinary full professorships   3  state of the art in science and technology  neither is the task of relieving urban structures from c limatic pressure completely new nor the strive for  heritage preservation and vital heritage towns  horayangkura 2017   however the combination of relieving vernacular houses within an urban planning context of c limatic pressure while limiting the use of primary  energy and maintaining the heritage value in the hot and hum id climate of south asian historic cities like  chiang mai is new territory   sociological analysis of societal demands on thermal comfort the american society of heating  refrigerating and air conditioning engineers  ashrae  standard 55 describes thermal comfort as the condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment  kolokotsa et al  2012   from  this perspective thermal comfort is the satisfacto ry stress free thermal environment in buildings and  therefore is a socially determined notion defined by norms and expectations  nicol and roaf 2017   an  acceptable level of thermal comfort meets a critical level of social demands understood as the collective expectations on thermal comfort held by residents of heritage buildings  empirical research indicates that there is large variation of social demands on indoor thermal comfort depending on different climates times  of year and culture  nicol et al  1999   in addition to the diversification of socially acceptable levels of comfort  increasing levels of income per capita come with higher expectations on thermal services  to anticipate the  diverse and local nature of thermal comfort social structure analysis can create a baseline model for the socially acceptable design as a space for thermal co mfort improvements  the sinus milieus are a prominent on values and beliefs  sinus 2020   however sinus is not problem specific and methodologically non transparent  non commercial approaches such as otte lifestyle typology  2004  offer more promising points  of departure for developing a problem centered social structuration analysis of urban and rural residents  values and beliefs towards energy efficient thermal comfort improvements of their historical buildings   adaptation of historic buildings and neighbourhoods the arrangement and architecture of residential  buildings have evolved over generations and have been ada pted to the social and climatic conditions of the  respective location  punpairoj 2013   the most effective adaption of houses to the hot and humid climate in  chiang mai was the use of raised floors and a loose fit alignment of wooden beams for floors and walls to  allow wind to pass through the house  shimizu 2018   structural changes to historic buildings such as a walled storage room under the raised first floor and a rain t ight roof inhibit the air flow and thus the natural  cooling effect of traditional houses nowadays  the perception of temperature depends strongly on the distribution of direct  solar  and indirect  surface  radiation as well as existing air movements  all these factors  can be positively influenced by urban design measures  materials greening pathways square design water  surfaces  and be combined with measures for climate protection  lütke daldrup 2011 ahlhelm et al  2016    passive energy saving measures today relying only on natural ventilation as a traditional passive cooling  system in thailand  tantasavasdi et al 2011  in ur ban areas is challenging bec ause the surroundings have  a significant impact on the wind pattern and air pollution rendering this energy efficient solution to cooling  needs insufficient  the main advantage of passive measures is their continuous functionality without or only very little energy input  in traditional wooden buildings already equipped with modern energy intensive ac such measures could lead to considerable even major energy savings and co 2 reduction  in this context  there are several different possible retrofit solutions that can be combined with each other  in hot and humid  climates internal wall insulation is actual preferable to external insulation in order to keep the cool air inside   this offers the following advantages it is easier and cheaper to install and would not change the  external  heritage look  it would offer inhabitants the possibility to create a modern individual living space inside a traditional wooden building  moreover it could be shown that the daily rainfalls during the rainy season could  also be used for the reduction of the cooling load  just by the application of a water buffering layer on the  roof and the subsequent latent heat effect during the drying out of such a layer after rain events the yearly energy demand of an example building c ould be reduced by approximately 35 %   strengthening collective efficiency of urban development projects the willingness and ability to  cooperate in transdisciplinary applied r&d projects is es sential for the collective efficiency of these efforts   kahneman and tversky  1992  have shown that individuals are keener on avoiding losses than on achieving  gains all else being equal   this leads to the hypothesis that defending the common resource heritage city  is more effective for cooperation than promoting the transformation into a smart city  results of the survey in the pilot districts indicate that about 80% of respondents are willing to engage in heritage preservation  activities  despite the potentially high engagement the collect ive effectiveness of these efforts ultimately  depends on horizontal  between initiatives  and vertical  between citizens and municipality  communication  way to tackle complex social ecological challenges in chiang mai transdisciplinary research has proven to be a challenging task in itself  the integration of research methods across academic disciplines the collaboration between researchers and practitioners and the need to balance societal and disciplinary  academic impacts pose many difficult ies even to experienced applied scientists  jaeger erben et al  2018    for the heritage sector the unesco bangkok concludes that there is a lack in transdisciplinary research capabilities  capacity development for transdisciplinary cooperation should focus on early career researchers and provide appropriate training coaching and mentoring as well as arenas for interaction or institutional  platforms that enable mutual social learning  in addition projects can experiment with changes of  arrangements and frameworks for transdisciplinary research at local universities  vertical communication community involvement in municipal communication infrastructure smart city  planning can strengthen vertical communication by involving citizens in democratic decision making co  creating smart city projects and by proactively using the city ict infrastructure  simonofski et al  2019    honoring the importance of citizens’ participation va rious technologies have been deployed in cities like  barcelona to enable communities to submit information regarding their needs complaints and interests  which in turn can be tied down to specific requests and actions  furthermore scientific reports describe the various aspects on how to strategically engage with the wi der community of relevance in order to achieve the  sustainable and collaborative concept identification and dev elopment of smart city districts  concepts such  as urban design thinking put the citizen with her his needs and requirements in the center of the developments  and lay the ground for the development of enabling digital technologies  weighting conflicting goals in collective decision making processes   to maintain the heritage value of  buildings not all available energy efficient technologi es can be applied  numerous research projects have  already worked on gentle refurbishment and technology integration strategies for heritage buildings e g    binder et al  2014   city of quedlinburg 2014   entrop 2013   in germany and in europe the work of wta   wissenschaftlich technische arbeitsgemeinschaft für bauwerkserhaltung und denkmalpflege e v   in the area of building conservation was groundbreaking to define standards and

goal of charms is to relieve vernacular houses of climatic pressure while limiting the use of  primary energy and maintaining the heritage value in the hot and humid climate of southeast asian  secondary cities  to meet this goal the following 4 mission statements jointly developed during the definition phase of  charms provide the strategic reference points for the design of activities and solutions   1  integration we combine technical and social innovations for the dev elopment of an integrated urban development strategy  for thermal improvements of historic buildings  2  participation we ensure social acceptance of the  developed solutions by integrating the users into the r&d process  3  holism we compare urban and rural context and ensure transferability of r&d results all over southeast asia  4  impact orientation we monitor  environmental and social impacts and ensure the economic ally sustainable implementation of r&d results   during the definition phase of charms the project team identified the districts of wat lam chang and wat  ket as the most suitable locations for the r&d phase  both districts have a significant proportion of traditional wooden buildings  fig  4  and a very active civil society  the latter is reflected in high level of engagement in heritage preservation activities  according to results of the pilot survey   however the districts differ in their social structures their urban thermal environment and potentially in their preservation status  due to the  application for world heritage status of the inner city where wat lam chang is located        objectives understand jointly develop and integrate capacitate and change  objective 1 is to establish a gis based baseline model against which any hypothetical impact of a

pilotumfrage   die bezirke unterscheiden sich jedoch in ihren sozialen strukturen ihrer urbanen thermischen umgebung und möglicherweise in ihrem schutzstatus  aufgrund der beantragung des welterbe status der innenstadt in der sich wat lam chang befindet    identifikation technischer  und sozialer lösungen  dem problem des fehlenden thermischen komforts sowie der unzureichenden luftqualität  innerhalb der historischen gebäude liegen verschiedene ursachen zugrunde  einerseits haben sich die ansprüche der jüngeren lokalen bevölkerung an thermischen komfort im vergleich zur eltern  und großelterngeneration geändert  ursache 1   diese veränderung  basiert auf einer lebensstil basierten veränderten nutzung der gebäude einer generell höheren erwartungshaltung an ein komfortables leben sowie einem höheren bewusstsein für  die gesundheitliche relevanz der thermischen bedingungen und der luftqualität in  holzwohnhäusern  um ein breites verständnis der lokalen einstellungsmuster zu energie  und ressourceneffizienter gebäudeertüchtigung im historischen bestand zu entwickeln wurde durch das fraunhofer zentrum für internationales management und wissensökonomie imw in der definitionsphase ein neuer ansatz der problemzentrierten sozialstrukturanalyse  entwickelt  der pilotierte ansatz wird in der fue phase weiterentwickelt und skaliert   investitionen zur erzeugung und aufrechterhaltung einer angenehmen raumluft qualität konzentrieren sich heute in der regel auf aktive kühlsysteme wie klimaanlagen  ursache 3   einerseits wird dadurch der energieverbrauch der gebäude substantiell erhöht  andererseits  trägt die abluft der klimaanlagen potentiell zur entstehung von wärmeinseln bei  zusätzliche  maßnahmen zur verbesserung der gebäudehülle wie innenwanddämmung luftdichtheit und andere technische verbesserungen oder traditionelle passive systeme die langfristig sowohl energie als auch finanzielle ressourcen sparen würden werden selten in betracht gezogen  die entwicklung material basierter maßnahmen zur erhöhung des thermischen komforts in  holzwohnhäusern wird durch das fraunhofer institut für bauphysik ibp eingebracht   „innovation challenge 1    in der vergangenheit wurde ausreichend thermischer komfort historischer holzwohnhäuser durch passive natürliche kühlmaßnahmen sichergestellt  der innenraumkomfort der gebäude  basierte auf der passfähigkeit von architektur und urbanem  mikro  klima  aufgrund der durch  den klimawandel gestiegenen außentemperatur der durch die urbanisierung verursachten veränderung des lokalen mikroklimas sowie der hohen luftverschmutzung wird durch die traditionellen kühlungsmaßnahmen kein ausreic hender innenraumkomfort mehr sichergestellt   ursache 2   während der definitionsphase wurde eine erste analyse des lokalen mikroklimas  vorgenommen sowie der lokale gebäudebestand erfasst und typologisiert  auf dieser basis  werden durch das fraunhofer institut für ener giewirtschaft und energiesystemtechnik iee  klimamodelle und lösungsansätze auf gebäude   „ innovation challenge 2  und  umgebungsebene  „ innovation challenge 3  entwickelt und für die identifizierung von  lösungen angewandt   weiterhin ist die kollektive effizienz öff entlicher und privater maßnahmen zur erhöhung der  lebensqualität in historischen quartieren und gebäuden der stadt chiang mai gering  ursache 4   als gründe sind hier die fehlende abstimmung der initiativen untereinander die unzureichende kommunikation zwischen der stadt chiang mai und den lokalen anwohnern  sowie die unzureichende befähigung von städtischen entscheidungsträgern zielkonflikte zu  managen zu benennen  chiang mai soll staatlich gefördert zu einer „smart city weiterentwickelt werden  die aktuelle planung sieht keine systematische integration von it  basierten mechanismen zur interaktion zwischen stadtverwaltung und lokalen anwohnern vor  das fraunhofer institut für offene kommunikation ssysteme fokus setzt an dieser stelle an  und entwickelt it basierte konzepte zur verbesserung der kommunikation zwischen  anwohnern und stadtverwaltung  „ innovation challenge 4    zur stärkung der kommunikation zwischen ei nzelnen initiativen hat das fraunhofer imw in  der definitionsphase ein weiterbildungsprogramm entwickelt und pilotiert  in kooperation mit der unesco bangkok wird dieses in der fue phase weiterentwickelt und asean weit  skaliert  zur vorbereitung der weiterbildungsaktivitäten identifiziert das imw asean weit  soziale innovationen zur verbesserung des thermischen komforts  dieser katalog sozialer innovationen baut auf einem in der definitionsphase entwickelten innovationskatalog auf und findet sowohl in den weiterbildungsaktivitäten  als good practices  als auch in der entwicklung  einer technologisch sozial integrierten lösung zur erhöhung des thermischen komforts  als  praktiken und organisationsformen  anwendung  schließlich stärkt das fraunhofer ibp die standardisierung von entscheidungsprozessen im bereich der energieeffizienten erhöhung des thermischen komforts in historischen gebäuden durch die anpassung relevanter merkblätter der wissenschaftlich technischen  arbeitsgemeinschaft für bauwerkserhaltung und denkmalpflege e v  sowie des europäischen  cen tc 346 standards zur „erhaltung des kulturellen erbes  „ innovation challenge 5    integrativer teil des entwicklungsproze sses der benannten lösungen ist das systematische  einholen von strategischem  auf basis eines innerhalb der definitionsphase etablierten  experten beirats  und lokalem  auf basis eines community board  feedback zur ökonomischen ökologischen und sozialen passfähigkeit der lösungen   integration der lösungsansätze und strategische verwertungsplanung  das herzstück des vorhabens charms ist die entwicklung einer integrierten urbanen entwicklungsstrategie zur energie effizienten kulturell sensiblen erhöhung des thermischen komforts von historischen holzhäusern auf basis der ergebnisse der fünf innovation  challenges und der identifizierten sozialen innovationen zur verbesserung des thermischen  komforts  in einem ersten schritt werden die entwickelten lösungen der drei  herausforderungen für technische innovationen in das sozio klimatische basismodell  übertragen um deren langfristige klimatische auswirkungen und soziale akzeptanz zu bewerten  basierend auf einem interdependenzm odell der auswirkungen des urbanen klimas  auf die komfortbedingungen von historischen gebäuden in innenräumen werden maßnahmen  in der direkten gebäudeumgebung gegen technische und strukturelle maßnahmen am  gebäude selbst abgewogen  dies führt zu einer reihe verschiedener technologisch machbarer und klimatisch vorteilhafte r maßnahmen  diese maßnahmen werden dem  community board und dem experten beirat vorgestellt  basierend auf den rückmeldungen zu technologischer passform sozialer akzeptanz und wirtschaftlicher tragfähigkeit werden  die maßnahmen weiter angepasst  schließlich werden die angepassten technologischen maßnahmen mit den identifizierten sozialen praktiken und organisationsmodellen  angereichert um eine erste integrierte strategie zu entwickeln  die strategie wird wieder den  beiden beiräten vorgestellt um sie über das erneute feedback weiter anzupassen  das ergebnis wird im letzten schritt mit den ergebnissen der innovation challenges 4 und 5  angereichert  it basierte kommunikation standards  und auf diese weise mit maßnahmen zur verbesserung der lokalen und nationalen rahmenbedingungen gekoppelt  der  integrationsprozess wird durch die universität chiang mai geleitet   das entwickelte strategie dient als input für die verwertungsplanung der fue ergebnisse  um die wirtschaftlich nachhaltige umsetzung der forschungsergebnisse von charms in der implementierungsphase zu unterstützen wird ein geschäftsmodell für deren markteinführung  und skalierung sowie eine roadmap für die umsetzung der strategischen planung entwickelt   „innovationsstrategie   hierfür nutzt charms einen standardisierten prozess für die verwertungsplanung von fue ergebnissen der am fraunhofer imw im rahmen
