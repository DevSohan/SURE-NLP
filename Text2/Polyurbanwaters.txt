 deeper transferable and scalable knowledge a nd know  how for their effective localization  a key challenge is to  overcome sectoral fragmentation at national and local governance levels to ensure more integrated and inclusive  approaches for transitioning urban spaces to sustainability  this is especia lly applicable to the critical gap at the  juncture between urban water management and urban planning  the applied research project polyurbwater  addresses this gap by exploring the multiple interlinkages between both sectors and by developing concepts  and t ools for planning and governance approaches for fast growing secondary and tertiary cities southeast asia   sea  a region that remains under  researched  roberts 2014  daniere et al  2020   the results from the  project definition phase confirmed the pa rticular relevance of the nexus between water management and urban  planning as well as the limitations of classical approaches towards infrastructure development and planning in  comprehensively addressing social economic and environmental vulnerabilities that will be drastically  exacerbated by climate change  based on the hypothesis that polycentric approaches to urban water  management can address mismatches between needs and capacities of these cities the research project  polyurbwater pursues the followi ng questions  1  how can a diverse set of stakeholders contribute to building an inter   and transdisciplinary local knowledge base on water and urban development related challenges in the sea region? how can this knowledge be systemati zed scaled and regularly updated to serve as a basis for inclusive and future  oriented municipal planning approaches across the region? 2 how can effective and sustainable water  sensitive urban development be

processes inform ne w practice  oriented pedagogies capacity building approaches and research agendas to strengthen a network of academic institutions in the region? polyurbwater is a project of an inter   and transdisciplinary research consortium of academic institutions civ il  society organizations public government institutions private sector actors and cities from cambodia germany  indonesia laos thailand and vietnam  polyurbwater focuses its research activities around three living labs  located in sleman  indonesia  s am neua  laos  and kratie  cambodia  which provide a representative cross   section of the challenges faced by fast  growing secondary and tertiary cities in sea in diverse governance  contexts  the research will develop and test innovative and transferable t ools for inclusive cross  sectoral  decision  making for polycentric water  sensitive urban development and support its exemplary implementation   the project will develop a research and learning partnership across sea and with germany  close cooperation  with regional and multilateral organizations such as unescap and german water partnership  g  will allow  here urban water

unplanned urbanization significan tly accelerates supply gaps in  water  related municipal public services and the overexploitation of water resources has reached alarming levels  in many contexts  world bank group 2016  adb 2018 unescap 2019   because planning frameworks are  often highly centralized sectoral and designed to fit within ideal typical planning cycles they are unable to  capture the complex and fast changing interface between water management and urban development needs  and address long  term changes   while global agendas such as sdgs or nua offer some orientation towards a holistic vision key obstacles are  a lacking knowledge base that connects a deep local understanding of current challenges and available  resources as well as cross  sectoral processes tools and c apacities to plan and steer effective transformation   gutterer and reuter 2016    polyurbwater seeks to develop tools and frameworks for cross  sectoral cooperation  that bridge existing silo approaches by bringing together different sectors and relevant sta keholders such as  public entities private sector communities civil society and academia  most integrated solutions are not solely  technical but rely heavily on both social  ecological and governance dimensions as well as the strong participation  of loca l stakeholders in planning processes as key drivers of change  polyurbwater integrates this  transdisciplinarity by working with a diverse team collaborati ng with state and non  state actors t hus increasing  the chances of securing sustainable gains  e g  o strom 1996 watson 2014  huchzezmeyer & misselwitz 2016     effective responses to current challenges require the ability to first acknowledge and then integrate a multiplicity  of predicaments that prevent positive and sustainable transitions  this multiplicity crystallizes in cities where  various stakeholders have to generate synergies and understand trade  offs between ecological social and  political transformation to anchor water  sensit ive development and climate action  the greatest challenge in  being able to achieve this aim is often not technology or capit al but rather a generation of knowledge the  integration of regulatory frameworks and the empowerment of practitioners with the right sensibilities skills and  conceptual agility to guide this transformation process  large cities are hard  pressed to find and train staff with  these capabilities for secondary and tertiary cities in sea this challenge is even more demanding   sheng 2010    a key sensitizing concept for the proposed research project is that of urban resilience which has become widely  used in research and development contexts  meerow et al  2016  béné et al  2018   the great challenge of  resilience is that it is still a relatively abstract concept to many decision  makers in sea  due to its multi  sectoral  nature resilience is still difficul t to frame and relatively complex to understand how it differs from more classic  public policy tools  in parallel the concept suffers from the catch  all syndrome by which resilience appears to  such as water  sensitive citi es water

 as well as urban governance processes  daniere et al  2020  including the consideration of  social ecological systems  flynn & davidson  2016  and the more practice focused exploration of concepts such  as sponge cities  where research is often limited to the megacities of the region  secondary and tertiary cities  struggle to obtain adequate support and often fail to attract long  term research into their specific conditions  resources and challenges despite shouldering the largest proportional share of urban growth  marks 2018 tzu  ling chen et al  2020    birkmann et al   2016  emphasize the need to boost water  related resilience of  secondary and tertiary cities because they frequently struggle s imultaneously with fast er population growth high  vulnerability to climate change and environmental disasters lower budgets and weaker institutional capacities    a further characteristic of local urbanization frontiers of such cities is the simultaneous presence of and  hybridiza tion between rural and urban lifestyles rural and urban organizational forms and hierarchies including  decision  making structures  in planning literature this condition is often referred to as peri  urban or desakota   mc gee & shaharudin 2016   scholarly research on the impact of this dynamically changing urbanization  frontier on water systems and related practices and lifestyles remains underdeveloped   a second sensitizing concept is the notion of polycentricity and polycentric approaches that the proje ct seeks to  apply to the management of urban waters  the idea of polycentric approaches builds on work from ostrom et  al   1961  which has since evolved to describe a complex form of governance wi th multiple centers of decision   making each of which oper ates with some degree of autonomy  carlisle & gruby 2017   the nua specifically  calls for integrated polycentric approaches that strengthen the role of small and intermediate cities   united  nations 2017  pp  24  however without definition of how this vision could be operationalized  this project  considers a water  sensitive polycentric approach to urban development to signify that multiple sectors work  together with various local public and private stakeholder groups integrating urban planning wit h water  management using centralized and decentralized approaches  such polycentric management of urban water  resources needs to include the various meanings of water in its social environmental and economic dimensions and  therefore requires the inclusion of multiple stakeholder groups and the formulation of a collective water  sensitive vision  that can be governed from multiple centers of responsibility  neto 2016  narain et al  2018 bustillos evers & ribbe  2019    here polyurbwater intends to co  create water  sensitive urban development scenarios with the pilot cities to  foster urban resilience and strive towards the localization of the sdgs   beyond the formulation of a water  sensitive vision methods and tools are required that enable a long term  transition process towards water  sensitive and polycentric urban planning  globally numerous tools and  methods aim to contribute to water  sensitive development urban resilience and the implementation of the sdgs   savic et al  2016  andersson e t al  2019  lund et al  2019 rall et al  2019    however many of these solutions  have been applied in regions with relatively low urban growth rates and static governance systems such as  reuter  2016   bai  201 8b  frantzeskaki  2019  and dorst et al   2019   such solutions aim for multifunctionality  of space  nesshöver et al  2016  which is of central importance in dense urban areas and provide both ecosystem  services and infrastructure services in urban se

environments in secondary sea cities in a cost effective and su stainable manner  haase 2015   in this context small  low tech and nature  based approaches are becoming increasingly important as resilience practitioners recognize the  lower costs associated with leveraging ecosystem services to protect cities against r esource depletion and extreme  weather events   gutterer et al  2012 unescap 2019    a significant knowledge gap exists in how polycentric approaches at the city level in sea can be shaped on  technical social  ecological and governance dimensions  furlong & kooy 2017  bai 2018b  and how their  development can be translated in regulatory frameworks and in institutional capacities   co management & co   production   sheng 2010   accordingly there is great need for instruction regarding what it can mean for  secondary and tertiary cities in sea to break down silos in terms of interdepartmental in ter agency or cross   boundary co operation and coproduction for

major research findings of definition phase that were common to the three case studies are   all national development plans that guide planning in the three partner cities call for sdg localization or for  sdgs to be converted and implemented in a concrete urban development plan  in various forms the cities  have elaborated initial strategies to ma ke their cities liveable ecologically sustainable economically efficient  inclusive and climate friendly  they have identified the comprehensive and effective management of urban  water resources as a strategic element for this development    mainstream ur ban planning and development models such as the development and implementation of  centrally planned and managed technical infrastructure solutions are not sufficient to meet the changing  dynamics of the urban areas    various drivers and pressures related to urban water resources have contributed to a system where the partner  cities struggle with the reliable provision of drinking water are unable to effectively manage wastewater and  stormwater and are unable to cope with extreme weather events  e g  dr oughts and floods     the municipal government structures have a limited capacity to actively shape urban transformation  processes which is reflected in the insufficient development of a management framework for urban water  resources  rapidly progressing l and use changes and poor solid waste management leads to flooding of  urban areas the washing out of existing sewage systems and water quality issues damaging both public  infrastructure and private property as well as threatening public health  diarrhea dengue etc      financeability and sustainable maintenance of effective water  sensitive infrastructure overwhelm the partner  cities  due to a lack of sufficient capacities mandates and financing instruments public  sector institutions act  reactively rathe r than proactively    due to insufficient inconsistent and fragmented regulatory frameworks and poorly coordinated mandates of public  bodies markets for decentralized systems are barely developed  operating models for existing wastewater  sectorial concepts in their realities  a high degree of flexibility modularity and polycentricity must be a key feature of water  sensitive infrastructure development for such cities  there is increasing awareness among city managers that the un principle of progressive implementation  evolving infrastructures  should guide infrastructure development  in reality this principle must be adequately defined according to the local context implemented and sustainably maintained hence there are onl y few precise ideas about this at the planning and decision  making levels of the partner cities  the previous 12 months of work culminated in presentations and discussion of our project work with the local  and national governments  sleman 17 6 2020 sam neua 23 6 2020  kratie 9 7 2020   who then  acknowledged the potential of polycentric management of their urban waters towards the sustainable  development of their cities  the cities approved the methodological approach of living labs as appropriate to  gain comprehensive k nowledge about water in their cities and develop strategic management approaches for  a transition towards water  sensitive cities  the profile of polyurbwater interventions in the cities have been  selected according to the following criteria a  relevan ce to project objectives gain in scientific knowledge  and potential for development of methods and tools b  relevance to local needs for such interventions  already voiced or demonstrated by residents municipality c  impact level of value added provide d by the  project  d  minimization of risks for project implementation  e  institutional

and heterogeneity of the three cities  decisions were taken to elaborate a customized comprehensive approach for kratie and sam neua at the  overall city level and for sleman at a local district level  the local government of sleman suggested six sub   districts as potential living labs  after comprehensive assessments based on the aforementioned criteria  the overall project goal is defined as  polycentric approaches to the management of urban  water resources contribute to the water  sensitive  transformation of secondary and tertiary cities in sea  towards resilient inclusive and livable urban areas thus  contributing to the fulfillment of national and global  sustainability agendas   the specific project goal is defined as  elaboration of an e mpirically proven conceptual  framework polycentric approaches to the management  of urban water resources for secondary and tertiary cities  in sea with a  development of relevant instruments for  its implementation and scalability and b  a sustainable c ontribution to the systematic emergence of a new  interdisciplinary practice  oriented research and economic  academic cooperation context    as a practice  oriented research project

modular format w ith learning units  that follow a given format and can be exchanged between partners to serve multiple capacity building purposes   the instruments to be developed are predominantly based on municipal practice and developed in cooperation  with municipal acto rs hence research questions are addressed in the real environment with the actors on the  ground  the innovation processes necessary for a transformation of municipal practice will occur during the  project implementation phase  other cities in all five co untries participating in the project have expressed their  interest in implementing these instruments  although living labs and empirical surveys are not feasible without  an intensive physical presence on site and regular meetings to maintain cooperative re lationships we plan to  reduce air travel emissions by avoiding unnecessary trips in the instances where a virtual presence suffices and  our strong network of sea partners will be empowered to manage

collection of dynamic social technological and geophysical components that co  evolve through  interactions among s takeholders institutions  local government water operators etc   and water systems such as  surface source water groundwater wastewater sanitation and stormwater  firstly existing water  related  infrastructure and their associated governance and manag ement systems will be assessed  subsequently the  results of this assessment will be combined with assessment results from  3  5 and  6 to underpin the  vision building process with realistic technical social and economic information which in a f urther step will support  the co  creation of customizable transition pathways towards sustainable water  sensitive infrastructure and robust  water governance schemes at the community and city level  a mixed methods approach including spatial analyses  network analyses participatory data collection focus group discussions and interactive simulation models will be  used to pursue the objectives of  4  special attention will be paid to gender related issues within the social   ecological systems and to the m ultifunctionality of space which is essential in fast changing
