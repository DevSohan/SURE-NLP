century the majority of the world population will live in cities  asia has one  of the highest urbanisation rates in the world and vietnam cities are among the fastest growing  in asia  cities embody some of the most pressing so cietal challenges the provision of necessary  and sustainable basic infrastructure and services such as water supply sanitation waste manage   ment energy and mobility  oecd 2018   cities are f acing increasing resource depletion   including  land resources   and environmental degradation oft en extending far beyond city boundaries   in order to respond to these challenges cities inc reasingly need to meet the requirements of sus   tainability and  or resilience  where sustainabilit y aims to rebalance the world permanently resili   ence looks for ways to cope with an unbalanced worl d  accordingly sustainability and resilience  have to go hand in hand  arup 2015    cities are often closely intertwined with the peri  urban and rural areas surrounding them whether  in terms of the flows of people goods products an d information or transport the use of resources  or the problems caused by lack of sustainability an d the associated vulnerability  this also applies  to the resulting challenges  − scarcity and depletion of energy water and other resources  requires sustainable and socially respon sible  planning and provision of technical infrastructure and measures focusing on resource efficiency   − increasing destruction of natural environment  req uires sustainable and appropriate land use concepts    − climate change  requires mitigation and adaptation measures   − migration towards cities  requires appropriate inf rastructure housing   in the context of rapid urbanisation planning and implementation must be able to keep up with this  pace including and in particular as regards infras tructure  not only the quality of infrastructure an d  services is important but also the speed with whic h they are provided  it requires both forward  planning and an appropriate understanding of the dy namics of urban development in order to avoid  infrastructure decisions that force cities into inf lexible concepts designed only to deal with short  term problems  urban development that leads to sust ainable resource efficient solutions requires  cooperation across hierarchies sectors technologi es and projects   the oecd policy review vietnam  2018  notes that vi etnam urban population has almost dou   bled since 1990 mainly due to rural urban migration   this also applies to the emplement! project  area the city of da nang  2018 1 1 million inhabi tants 2030 2 5 million  and the neighbouring  quang nam province  2018 1 5 million  with the cap ital tam ky  the challenges posed by this  rapid growth must be met by efficient planning  wit h this in mind numerous strategies  green  growth resilience etc   as well as master plans f or vietnamese cities have been developed  their  often very ambitious designs and the adherence of r igid standards often lead to unrealistic unaf   fordable concepts which are consequently hardly fea sible  vietnam national report 2016    many international organizations support cities lik e da nang in developing strategies to strengthen  their resilience or to promote a green economy  w ithin the framework of these strategies many  important goals are defined  however in terms of p ractical implementation e g  with regard to the  strategies can be translated into systemic  synerge tic planning and implemented effectively  in vi   etnam the administration has made great progress in many areas in recent years but the capacity  development required to cope with the planning and implementation problems still remains an  important task to be solved  vietnam national repor t 2016   capacity development at various lev   els is an indispensable prerequisite for cities to become more sustainable and resilient and to be  able to incorporate integrated approaches also wit h regard to the urban rural region system   oecd 2018    2 state of scientific and technological development  own previous work and work  and results from the definition phase  state of science and technology  hameed and nadeem already addressed the problems an d challenges of implementing strategies  and plans in 2008  they note in this context that  after the completion of a master plan it is urgent ly  necessary to focus on implementation tools for the plans since the completion of a master plan for  a city itself does not guarantee the implementation of the proposals or objectives contained therein   wbgu  2017  takes up the issue as a commentary on t he habitat iii forum and states that the  new urban agenda  nua  also lacks practical guideli nes for implementation and corresponding  monitoring mechanisms   this is also reflected in the implementation of vie tnam green growth strategy for the national  action plan   implementing the agenda for sustainab le development by 2030 which was accom   panied by the adoption of a number of laws  impleme ntation is proving difficult even for vietnamese  experts because the action plans are not coordinat ed with one another and thus offer few concrete  starting points for implementation  another factor is the lack of qualified experts for the practical  implementation of the green growth strategy  even i f measures are implemented sporadically un   der the strategy their indicator based evaluation is limited because clear evaluation schemes are  either not available or cannot be applied due to la ck of expertise  v hauff 2020    the need for capacity development both in the admin istration and at universities is a recurring  theme in the context of workshops and meetings als o from the official side  for example a lack of  specialist knowledge at the technology level means that those responsible in the departments of  infrastructure planning have problems in classifyin g and evaluating the suitability or usefulness of  information e g  on technology systems often prov ided by foreign companies or organisations   this considerably slows down the decision making an d thus also the implementation processes   moreover the lack of professional and technical kn ow how makes it difficult to develop synergetic  interdisciplinary and cross departmental implementa tion options  additionally there are often ob   stacles at various levels  legal spatial infrastr uctural etc   that can only be overcome by cross  departmental cooperation  however there are usuall y no appropriate mechanisms for this   in recent years some of the problems mentioned hav e been addressed through projects in vietnam  developing a methodology for trans sectoral planning in the field of supply and disposal infrastruc  ture  methods  data generation  computation  and tools for the analysis of material flows and the  identification of trans sectoral supply and disposal technologies will be made available   nevertheless further research is needed in the area of capacity development  it is important to  empower actors to identify and exploit synergies for the development of more sustainable systems  especially in the urban  rural  regional context  this is also the result of a recently completed project  of un habitat with da nang city in the framework of the green growth strategy   a profound technical education at universities and colleges is a prerequisite for the development of  efficient solution options  however the available study programs hardly deal with the possibilities  of linking technologies from different sectors such as energy water waste and agriculture  infor  mation on intelligent or complementary technologies can be found on various technology plat  forms such as e4c   engineering for change technology exchange lab and engineers without  borders etc  but here too the ability to evaluate the technologies is a prerequisite   technologies are an important component in the context of implementation and thus also of a sys  temic implementation approach  for this approach emplement! develops or uses different methods  in terms of implementation research  so far implementation research has been mostly applied in  medical educational and legal contexts  in terms of content however points of contact with imple  mentation research in emplement! can be found in studies that deal with the problems of the prac  tical implementation of laws i e  with the obstacles to the transposition of european law into national  law  ziller j  2007 fuchs m  2011  or the implementation of political guidelines  according to  peters et al  2013  implementation research attempts to solve a broad spectrum of implementation  problems  in other words it is the scientific analysis of implementation issues as an act of putting  an intention into practice  the factors that influence implementation the processes of implementa  tion itself and its results are the focus of the analyses within emplement!  own previous work in relation to the planned researc h  the following previous work was carried out in the thematic context of emplement! work and results from the definition phase  due to the good collaboration of the emplement! partners  german partners and un habitat vn   also with the vietnamese key actors as the people committees da nang tam ky and quang  nam province as well as dised the work in the definition phase could be carried out in a goal  oriented and interdisciplinary manner according to the work program  in addition further contacts  relevant for the next project phase  universities administrative departments communities etc    were made in the project area  at the national level coordinated by un

r&d phase an  advisory board was established including representatives from un habitat  nairobi and the  world resource institute  washington which meets twice a year on the progress of the project with  the emplement! coordination   excursions expert discussions and workshops with vietnamese partners and stakeholders as well  as data and information generated from remote sensing formed the

what to do but they contain  few concrete approaches to answer the question of how to do it  in other words they usually do  not describe in detail the technical practical implementation and the necessary prerequisites for  this e g  in terms of suitable technologies financial requirements know how or organisational  structures  this poses great challenges for many cities   also in the context of new planning laws  that have to be implemented   especially with regard to efficient land use planning and manage  ment  the overarching goal of emplement! is therefore to support cities by means of the structured  emplement! approach and thus the provision of transferable methods and instruments in their im  plementation processes  and further to anchor aspects of sustainability and climate protection and  to strengthen resilience through intensive cooperation in the urban rural region context  the follow  ing figure shows the project logic structured according to barriers activities expected outputs  achievement of objectives and potential impacts   with regard to the how in emplement! spatial stakeholder policy technology and process re  lated components are systemically integrated into an applicable and transferable implementation  approach including necessary methods and instruments  the approach involves relevant stake  holders and is flexible enough to keep pace with a rapidly changing environment   given their economic and social importance for the region the scope of emplement! covers the four  fields of action 1  tourism 2  agriculture  forestry 3  industry 4  built environment  in our context  buildings and small scale surroundings open spaces    in the run up to implementation activities in the 4 fields of action it has been taken into account  that these are not to be considered in isolation but rather systemically in a field of tension  there  is strong competition with regard to land water energy mobility  transport labour or financial re  or resources could be used jointly  renewable energ y   such a systemic approach not only helps to  avoid isolated measures but also takes into accoun t the conceptual and technical synergies be  tween the four fields of action as well as in the u rban regional nexus of the city of da nang and the  neighbouring quang nam province   with reference to the fields of action in a first step the existing strategies are analysed and dis  cussed in a goal oriented manner with regard to the ir formulated goals common features but also  contradictions  the methodology developed in the de finition phase  available as vs1 0  was used  for this analysis step which has already been initi ated   based on these results pilot projects were designe d together with local stakeholders as further  building blocks of the how to be implemented in the r&d phase  in an exemplary manner the  pilot projects show technical and  or conceptual po ssibilities for the four fields of action which in  their small scale meet the requirements of sustaina bility and resilience and which fulfil the specifi  cations of the new urban agenda  nua  and the susta inable development goals  sdgs    the pilot projects and their scientifically accompa nied implementation result in analysed and test  ed practically applicable modules that can be impl emented in spatially different contexts in the 4  fields of action  these modules are designed for sc alability and networkability which will open up  further possibilities for city regional cooperation    in order to strengthen cooperation in the project r egion across thematic spatial and administrative  borders a platform will be built to provide specif ic information on the city  region as well as on th e  pilot projects and to simplify promote and if ne cessary institutionalise the exchange of informati on  through common points of contact   know how and relevant expertise are fundamental pre requisites for the successful implementation  of measures  capacity development and empowerment o f the participating actors at both the plan   ning and the practice level are therefore central e lements in emplement! this also includes the  strengthening of the actors with regard to developm ent of efficient and sustainable concepts also  in terms of public private partnership   development implementation analysis and evaluatio n of the pilot projects which are carried out  together with local stakeholders are already desig ned as part of a practical capacity development  and empowerment process  the consideration of netwo rking opportunities of the pilot projects or  individual modules also contributes to sharpening t he systemic understanding of the stakeholders   the development adaptation and application of meth ods and instruments for implementation sup   port is carried out on three research levels    system level analyses of strategies plans fram ework conditions methods of data generation    technology level identification of suitable tech nologies process descriptions support of deci   sion making    implementation level identification of obstacles  implementation and scientific monitoring of pilot  projects research on implementation change and do wn to earth financing models w ithin the scope of the definition phase an analysis methodology was developed which is availa  ble as vs1 0 and will be continuously developed and adapted within the r&d phase  the method  ology which consists of four parts partly uses existing methods e g  the swot analysis   strength weakness opportunities threats  which evaluates strengths and weaknesses on the basis of internal fac  tors as well as taking into account opportunities and threats from external factors or pestel   polit  ical economic sociocultural technical environmental legal  a method that focuses specifically on external fac  tors  in the course of the development of the method pestel for emplement! was extended to  include the project relevant factors stakeholders and planning and is applied as a method compo  nent under the acronym stepples  in addition further proprietary methods such as obp   obstacle based planning   are further developed in order to identify obstacles in the implementation process of  strategies plans and measures and to work out with local stakeholder possible ways to overcome  them  in this context silo structures and encrusted thinking patterns are often to be overcome  in  order to consider the type and depth of cooperation and potential synergies at different layers  political levels  vertical horizontal  spatial or official informal the method component locs   level of cooperation and synergies   was developed which will be further developed in the r&d phase thus  completing the emplemethod methodology for implementation analysis   all methods instruments and materials  e g  for capacity development  developed  applied within  the framework of emplement! as well as the modules generated from the pilot projects are pre  pared compiled in the empletool toolbox and made available to potential users   indicators for the  quantitative and qualitative  de scription of project success because a broad spectrum of stakeholders at various levels of politics economy and civil society  is  must be  involved in these processes  in order to be able to structure and analyse or evaluate  these implementation processes the emplemethod methodology has been developed   when applying the methodology the identification of obstacles to implementation and the investi  gation of cooperation and synergy potentials play a central role  in particular these method steps   obp and locs  actively involve all relevant stakeholders at all levels in order to jointly develop  approaches as intermediate steps  objectives structured in terms of time and logic to overcome the  identified obstacles and to explore cooperation and transfer possibilities  the achievement of the  defined intermediate objectives already represents measurable indicators  quantitative and quali  tative  in the implementation process of measures to strengthen sustainability and resilience   dissolving e g  administrative barriers  organisational change processes change management   preventing the efficient implementation at city  regional level leads to a higher degree of coopera  tion and transfer between city and province  this change in cooperation  interaction in the course  of the project as of the status quo will be recorded and made measurable by means of suitable  indicators  contributions to sustainability and resource efficiency through implemented measures  and synergies exploited in this context as well as potentials to be realised through future measures  will be recorded qualitatively and quantitatively on the financial as well as material energy level and  presented in a comparable way  in order to methodically gather soft factors such as quality of life   environment health participation etc   appropriate procedures and indicators are developed to  gether with local partners   indirect economic social and  or political effects  for vietnam there is insufficient coordination between different city and province related policies  and as a consequence a lack of temporal content   especially with regard to socio economic and  environmental factors   and spatial coherence in the respective strategies and plans  there is also  a lack of incentives and mechanisms as well as the necessary tools to promote this coordination  and to tap the associated economic and social synergy potentials  this is confirmed by the oecd  in its urban policy review vietnam  oecd 2018  and is in line with the findings of the emplement!  definition phase  oecd studies have also shown that metropolitan areas with fragmented uncoor  dinated policies tend to have a lower level of productivity  vietnam in particular could benefit eco  nomically and socially from increasing effectiveness and efficiency through the pooling of resources  and better use of existing structures and capacities in cities and provinces   this is exactly where emplement! ties up for the region da nang  quang nam province with the  development of methods and tools that help to strengthen cooperation and transfer bundle re  sources and use synergies in the implementation of strategies and plans  this supports those and  as a transferable blueprint other regions in their economic and social development and the achieve  ment of goals e g  sdgs within the framework of the new urban agenda   to the further political discussion  policy recommendations  and to the development of future strat  egies and plans coordinated between cities and regions  the systemic cross link of pilot projects   modules contributes to the initiation of cooperation and through practical application to their con  tinuous strengthening and making them visible in the region

industry built environment   as an important project part pilot projects in the 4 fields of action will be implemented jointly with  local partners  modular scalable technologies are selected for this purpose taking into account the  local context and their synergy potential  the technologies should be resource efficient low emis  sion and counteract the increase in ghg   but they must also be financially viable and operational  in the long term  in the structured implementation dialogue it is important to find the balance be  tween what is technically feasible and what reasonable  in addition to sustainability resilience to  drought floods saltwater intrusion etc  must also be considered   an important basis for the work in emplement! is the analysis and evaluation of the existing frame  work giving strategies and plans as well as the practical demonstration projects and technologies  in terms of implementation research  for this purpose the methodology developed as emple  method  vs  1 0  is applied  the relevant indicators for the internal and external evaluation factors  are defined in the r&d phase together with the local partners   important prerequisite for implementation measures is specialist knowledge for which within  emplement! materials for local experts and decision makers are developed and made available in  a user friendly way  in addition to technical know how emplement! contributes to empowering  stakeholders to identify possible obstacles to implementation  structural technical spatial legal  social political  and to overcome them in an implementation oriented way  in this way emplement!  enhances competencies not only with regard to practical technical infrastructure planning and thus  also resilience but also by equipping stakeholders with the necessary know how and tools to effi  ciently carry out decision making and implementation processes   for the implementation of emplement! the intensive scientific exchange between the german and  vietnamese partners is an essential basis for the development of locally adapted solutions  for a  sustainable implementation however the commitment and support of the local authorities and the  people committees are indispensable which is why decision makers at different levels  national  to ward  are involved in emplement! as important partners  various groups in civil

avoids the  excessive consumption of natural resources offers local communities the opportunity to improve their socio economic  conditions and increases the resilience of local  eco systems  to this end previously isolated tourist villages  in da  nang and quang nam  which form the corners of a triangle that also includes the my son and hoi an world heritage  sites will be conceptually linked  the pilot projects also stimulate sustainable tourism activities in the mass tourism cen  tres of hoi an  quang nam  and da nang where severe environmental damage is already occurring   pilot project1  tourism concept for the cu de river valley  task 2 1  the concept focuses on the preservation of local cultural traditions and the protection of the environment  it supports  community based tourism development that comes along with socio economic improvements and a resilient infra  structure  the approach is supported by wastewater agriculture and forestry projects developed under other tasks  of this work package  the approach includes connectivity and interconnection of the communities located in the re  gion to promote cooperation and the development of a circular economy system   2

produc  tion is below the actual potential resulting in low income for smallholders  the traditional way of cultivation  which is  also an eye catcher for tourists  must be made more productive and also more efficient in terms of reducing greenhouse  gases  rice cultivation   considerable post harvest losses due to inadequate treatment of the products are a contributory  factor to the low productivity and low income of farmers  forest management methods   deforestation of entire parcels    tend to bring only short term profits and increase soil erosion  sometimes very steep slopes

the da nang university of science and technology  dut  possibly also the quang nam university  will be involved in the implementation and operational processes of pilot projects in order to provide  scientific  technical support  in addition interdisciplinary events  workshops  summer schools  will  be held in cooperation with them in order to conduct initial analyses of the implementation generate  further ideas and develop concepts  co design  for the 4 fields of action  the work is supported by  the subcontractors with their respective expertise   7 expected results application potential and envisaged utilisation of results  the structured implementation research within the framework of emplement! but above all the sci  entific results and products will enable stakeholders to broaden their view beyond their own urban  or regional borders and to exploit potential synergies  technological  procedural  financial  of imple  mentation measures  this is an important prerequisite for a future effective reduction of ghg emis  sions an efficient use of resources and a sustainable and robust infrastructure   already in the definition phase the establishment of an efficient research cluster for the region of  central vietnam was started from whose expansion the project partners from science and practice  will benefit   especially for the implementation of sustainability  green growth strategies planners and executing  companies depend on fact based information and experience  since green technologies are sup  posedly inferior to conventional technologies in terms of costs comprehensive knowledge of their  performance and systemic effects and costs is crucial   besides respective computer simulations pilot or demonstration projects in particular show very  sustainable learning effects since in contrast to simulations they already include an initial imple  mentation step  furthermore pilot projects make the development and communication of an ab  stract methodology practically tangible and comprehensible and in this way contribute to the pro  motion of competences   although the 10 pilot projects are strictly speaking means to an end in the context of method devel  opment they will due to the requirements placed on them  e g  environmental technologies syn  ergy formation modularity scalability performance  provide important information and practical  for upscaling  sanitation modules for tourism f r u i t s   in the nur programme implementation  phase  it is also expected that the central vietnamese spatial decision and cooperation platform  can be realised   during the r&d phase the project partners will develop evaluate and publish reports and docu  mentations  presentations workshops  conferences discussion forums etc   so that relevant con  tents will be available to the scientific community ngos and the interested public   during bilateral meetings with the academy of managers for construction and cities   amc  re  sponsible for the further training of city managers and experts at all levels in vietnam  the deputy  leader clearly stated that emplement! will make a valuable contribution to building and developing  capacities with regard to implementation methods cooperation between cities and regions and  various technical aspects  especially waste and wastewater management renewable energies ef  ficiency potentials etc    amc is also highly interested in including emplemethod in its education  and training portfolio   the question of translating plans strategies and guidelines into practical outcomes is central to the  ig utp  international guidelines on urban and territorial planning  the nua  new urban agenda   and also the achievement of the sgds  sustainable development goals   the project will thus  serve as a vehicle for a better implementation of global reference documents such as ig utp nua  and sdgs and will thus play an important catalytic role   cooperation with un habitat and also unido  united nations industrial development organisa  tion  will ensure the necessary visibility within the international debate on sustainability and resili  ence as well as economic and technological cooperation  this will also be beneficial during and  especially after the r&d phase for the implementation and continuation of the pilot projects and  ensure that the project results of emplement! support vietnam in its efforts to achieve economically  socially and ecologically sustainable development and to achieve corresponding global goals   scientific connectivity results from the updating and thematic development of the emplement! ap  proach   i e  its continuous adaptation to new scientific findings and the evaluation of the results  from implementation activities  for the german economy positive effects are expected in connec  tion with  environmental  technology transfer capacity building and private sector dialogue  e g   on innovative and synergetic technologies in the context of pilot projects   with the project results  of emplement! which provide a broad pool of suitable and transferable options for the most diverse  technological challenges direct economic connectivity is also guaranteed   8 time and financing plan  the first two tables below provide an overview of the planned total
