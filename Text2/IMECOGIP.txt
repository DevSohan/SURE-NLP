stated the different degrees of  integration of the es concept into urban planning and  especially   into gi planning in the  two regional socio  cultural and political contexts of china shanghai  and

data with a high spatial  resolution < 1 m  that enable quantitative es assessments in shanghai and the ruhr area   during the r&d  phase imecogip will develop a user friendly scientifically sound and  spatially explicit open source toolbox to assess and evaluate es  demand and supply   synergies and trade  offs in the context of gi for different urban development scenarios  the toolbox will allow for comparative evaluations of es conformity of different planning  scenarios  we will develop and test methods how gi planning can be improved by applying  es principles in real word cases studies and using big data  the principal purpose is to  strengthen urban resilience   to that end we can rely on a consortium of distinguished researchers in three chinese  research institutions with far reaching relationships to provincial and local planning  the  imecogip network is backed  up by nine cooperation agreements  mous   in germany  together with municipalities and the ministry of

 roussel et al  2017 512  the lack absence of gi patches below the 'minimum mapping  unit of 1 ha' lead to 'noise' in the es assessment of fragmented areas in cities  they thus  state the necessity

assessment and research is the lack  of access to high  resolution lulc  data as well as the high transaction costs stemming  from the acquisition and processing of data  we therefore aim at an innovative approach  that offers a systematic approach to extract land  use cover data from high  resolution earth  observation data process it with ground  truth validation and merge it with additional lulc   date in a gis   database environment   as a major result of the definitio n phase we stated the different degrees of integration of  the es concept into urban planning and especially

nature and landscape  considering that addressing es was compulsory in the  provincial subsidiary program 'green infrastructure' yet the 'integrated action plans' do  not reflect es  this is for one part due to the inherited terminology in legal institutions and  for the other part due to different academic professional education of the experts and pol   iticians  often es categories are translated in a rather unreflect manner into 'landscape  studies and interviews during the definitions phase we now have clear understanding of  some entry  points to translate the multi

options for expressing the es significance  in monetary values  economic valuation can be a vehicle for better communication of es  to the public and decision makers as outlined in teeb but monetary valuation is not the  prime interest of the project    technically the project team decided to use the open source gis software qgis for the  development of models  as we make the most of high

and trade  offs  ws 219 615 827 1519   his literature studies and  expert  based knowledge will enable best results to support these core issues of the toolbox   the result of this step will be represent the es supply and demand in neighbourhoods and  districts  all results will be transparent and accessible  thus users can understand under    lying assessments and evaluations and we prevent a black box  each es will be made  comparable by developing a non dimensional index  ws 203 605 811 1510   after bal    ancing and weighing es the user will be able to compare results from different lulc  planning scenarios  ws 226 624 841 1523   the results will be scripted to process these  important steps of evaluating   toolbox development the main task of the staff member is the development of the toolbox   to automate calculations four toolbox versions  alpha beta gamma and delta  will be  developed and modular upgraded  in each version new es will be added former results  will be calibrated the user interface will be improved by user experience  ws 607  the  geodatabase will be updated and operating instructions of the toolbox will be documented  in manuals and later complemented by 'how  to videos  tutorials'    the alpha version   ws 200  will be a qgis add on based on model builder  the final product of this version  will be a raster map    the script of the beta version  ws 600  will be a python script and  a user friendly graphic user interface will be realized  results will include three scenarios  the status quo the target  state and the optimum state in graphical manners e g  spider  webs diagrams giving hints to planners how to improve the es conformity of the planning  area    the gamma version  ws 800  includes all es selected in the project  additionally  this version is able to calculate es demand and supply at two scales  at the local scale  based on lulc of vhr satellite images in china and vhr airborne images in germany  and at the regional scale the calculation is based on lulc of sentinel  2 and landsat     the delta version  ws 1500  is ready for the subsequent implementation phase and is  able to calculate further es of unspecified areas   furthermore a certification will be developed for es conformity urban spatial planning  ws  1350    bioqeoqraphy  rub scientist mb   the main task of the staff member will be the assess    ment of es as an ongoing process during the r&d phase  he will focus on the biotic as    pects of the work package  among his tasks are the corresponding screening and evalu   ation of data

evaluate to which extent generaliza   tions of biotic structures are acceptable and meani ngful  ws 601 806   therefore data  collection during field trips in china and germany is essential throughout the r&d phase  to constantly improve the database  the scientist will quantitatively investigate the signifi   cance of the within  biotope  biodiversity as this must to be taken into account in the trade   off analyses  this will be a major contribution to the development of the toolbox  ws 202  603 836 841   the evaluated es will be made available in a lulc shapefile  ws 205  615 841 1516    the work package contributes to the development of the toolbox by evaluating the trade   offs among the pre  selected es  ws 219 615 827 1519   ther efore the staff member  will develop non  dimensional indexes  ws 605 811 1510   afterwards balancing and  weighing es among each other is among his tasks to enable comparisons between differ    ent planning scenarios  the work package will also contribute to the development of scripts  to process these important steps of evaluating es  ws 226 624 841 1523    kooperationen und arbeitsteilung  the teams from rub and ils are based in

involved in developing the concep    tual design of the toolbox  more than half of the key es selected are cultural es such as  the recreational aesthetic and educational value resulting from different types of gi  by  providing feedback talks with experts from business academia and government repre    sentat ives for gi development and urban park management the project will deepen its  knowledge about the socio  structural perception of gi  these findings will help to improve  the methodological framework  weighing of indicators  and facilitate the applicability of the toolbox

conference'  in 2019 based on our expertise in the very field of imecogip  we see discussions with the higher levels of policy making as decisive to reach the project overall objective which  is implementation of es  thinking in gi  planning   the ruhr regional association  rvr  is responsible for the regional planning for the ruhr  region  currently it prepares the regional plan that determines the extent of regional green  belts and others  the rvr has also received the lead management for the 'offensive  grune lnfrastruktur 2030'  due to the corona epidemic it was not possible to finalize the  mou between rvr and imecogip  however in an e mail the department director ex    pressed hi s interest to join the imecogip at a later stage  the use of the toolbox to  monitor and
