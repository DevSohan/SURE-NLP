0  summary of the project the past decades saw the global south experiencing only a few locality  based resilience planning efforts  which would have generated prob lem solving practice models  while focusing on global city competition and  urban economy efficiency extremely marginalised urban poor have been often excluded from national plan  ning agendas including those in the philippines and other southe ast asian cou ntries as thailand and vi  etnam  despite the enactment of the philippine disaster risk reduction and management act of 2010  ra  10121  urban risk governance and risk  based land use planning to reduce inhabitants’ socio  economic vul  nerability and enhance co mmunity adaptive capacity for resilience has not gained wide efficacy   metro manila  and its large

absorption   1  justification of the identified research problems  1 1 updated regional compelling problems planning trends and actions  several decades of research ha ve produced considerable understanding of the complex and interacting con  sequences in global climate change and fast urbanization development  ipcc 2014 un 2017 un isdr  2015   however strategic risk reduction has not g ained significant traction in international debates particu  larly in regard to informal settlements in the global south where large gaps remain between the demands of  the public scientific studies and policy making  garschagen et al 2020   while often r ecognised as one of  the most ‘at risk’ places informal settlements have been directly and indirectly excluded from many formal  mechanisms thereby increasing their vulnerability to disaster events   morin  et al  2016 greiving et  al   2018   this challenge is particularly troublesome for the emerging economies of southeast asia including  the philippines vietnam and thailand where the prevalen ce of urban informality coincides with extremely  high exposure to natural hazards  birkmann and welle et al  2016    three countries with conjunction of informality and hazard exposure were selected to demonstrate a breadth  of historically and socio  politically grounded planning contexts in which to test the transferability of the pro  ject findings and proposed interventions  the first is metro manila  the largest and fastest growing metro  politan area in the philippines  the metropolitan region has for dec ades attracted migrants from the prov  inces not all of whom have found formal housing  national economic and development authority  neda  2017  estimated that there were 2 8 million informal settlers or 556526 informal settler families  isfs  living  in metro manila  out of this number 104000 families are occupying areas identified as danger zones such  as railroad tracks garbage dumps canals rivers and creeks and other flood  prone areas  many of these  isfs also live in houses made of light materials  and are therefore particularly vulnerable  despite precarious  living situation of isfs disaster  driven upgrading is currently still a low priority of planning in the philippines   in large part  however the focus is on finding large scale lasting solut ions to this perennial problem yet  these often entail moving people far from their livelihoods and thus have limited success  as such there is a  demand for new approaches and insights that help gain traction on how to support effective upgrading and or  retreat in the current context   hanoi has a similar situation to metro manila in terms of hazard exposure  mostly flooding  and re developing  informal settlements  along with the growing trends of immigration into hanoi it has been argued that hazard  prone areas are an integral part of hanoi migration dynamic in that it creates the conditions that have made  certain areas of the city affordable thus enabling settlement by low  income people  anh and minh 2017    the majority of migrants especially migran ts without residential registration have no opportunity to access  any information from district  level authorities and thus lack the support that is being offered to formal resi  dents from district  level government  though informal settlements are decreasi ng as a result of the general  the city infrastructure  anh and minh 2017   however it is still unclear how the remaining informal settle  ments would be redeveloped for instance with upgra ding or relocation measures and for whom they would  be redeveloped  as in manila the informal economy and informal settlements are deeply connected yet the  legal  political context of the socialist republic of vietnam is quite different from the one in th e philippines   bangkok has considerable experience with slum  upgrading and social housing projects for the urban poor  since the 1970s  bhatkal and lucci 2015    however until today an estimated 25 % of the urban population  of thailand remains living in slums or informal settlements  world bank 2020  and 30 % communi ties in  bangkok were defined as informal settlements  bma 2018   accordingly bangkok and its hinterland are  appropriate research sites to learn from decade  long experiences and to exchange with metro manila given  its awareness on spatial planning  based d isaster risk management  though thailand has different develop  ment capacities due to its socio  economic performance it has less concrete disaster risk management reg  ulations and enforcement than the philippines and particularly vietnam  additionally the country struggles to  address pressing trends such as social inequality an ageing society and environmental degradation  in the  light of the projected growth of thailand urban population from 50% today to 70% by 2050  undesa 2018   the vulnerability of urban systems and the resilien ce of bangkok informal settlements are central challenges   1 2 current international deb ates and scientific discourses disasters in cities can arise from natural processes such as weather  related  hydro  meteorological  and ge  ophysical hazards and also from human actions  understanding disaster risks is a prerequisite not only for  disaster risk reduction but also for the assessment of climate change impacts and planning effective adapta  tion strategies  winsemius et al  2016    mainstreaming drr has gradually gained momentum since 1994   undrr 2019   however since 2015 there has been a further push to ensure that disaster risk management  and climate change resilience are coherent including in relation to key post  2015 global agendas notably  the sendai framework of disaster risk reduction the paris agreement adaptation goal the sustainable  development goals and the new urban agenda  sandholz et al  2020    spatial planning is one sphere in which such coherence is being sought  it plays an important role in climate  change adaptation and disaster risk reduction particularly as it offers tools to proactively and preventively  reduce risk  adb 2016 greiving 2016    to develop the full potential of spatial planning it is key to understand  the determinants of climate risk – hazard exposure and vulnerability – and how physical climate and envi  ronmental changes interact with the human socio  economic system  birkmann und mcmillan 2019     as poorly managed urbanisation is a major driver of disaster risk  hossain et al  2017  and poor people are  often the most severely affected by disasters  unisdr 2017  it is imperative to introduce risk  informed spa  tial planning mechanisms in areas where the urban poor mostly live  un 2017   in many countries of the  global south these areas are informal settlements  here residents are typically more exposed to climate  events with very limited risk  reducing infrastructure low  quality housi ng and limited capacity to cope   unisdr 2009 ipcc 2012 revi et al  2014  morin e t al  2016 tran and krause 2019   they live outside  systems and provide the urban poor with ‘risk  reducing’ infrastructure and services two central features  named by the ipcc fifth assessment for achieving risk reduction  revi et al  2014    aligned with this is an  attention to supporting physical infrastructures to have better q uality despite the rapidity of growth  undrr  2019  this could include for example the improvement of the accessibility the sanitation the building material  or the water and energy provision  however across sectors vulnerability reductions can also be supported  by other services including through improved health care emergency aid disaster management or policing   across sectors activities of this nature can be referred to as ‘upgrading ’ of informal settlements  they fall into  the categories protect ion and particularly accommodation  named as major coping mechanisms for coastal  communities exposed to natural hazards in ipcc  fifth assessment report  ar5   the last category of  ‘retreat ’ is in contrast referred to as an option of last resort and bec omes a justifiable strategy when the other  adaptation options are not practicable – although this may be assessed on different timescales either as  immediate or in future due to climate change impacts such as sea level rise  ipcc 2014 greiving et al 2018     upgrading and planned  manag ed  retreat are not merely a matter of providing settlements with infrastructure  and services or clearing hazard areas while settling people somewhere else in less exposed areas  both  interventions interfere with urban development processes such as exclus ion rising land prices public  transport planning gentrification and functional separation  moreover existing upgrading and retreat  strategies widely ignore the specific susceptibility of the various elements at risk and fail to assess whether  they are worth protecting  doberstein et al  2020   thus they tend to upgrade or relocate entire settlements  instead of distinguishing between those elements which may remain and others for which a relocation is  required  so called selective retreat see greiving et al  2018    urban resilience narratives are distinctly influenced by engineering  based understandings focusing on  critical infrastructure needs and risk reduction as main points of intervention  cis are addressed at the global  level as one of the sev en global targets of the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction substantially  reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services among them health and  educational facilities including through developing their resil ience by 2030  un isdr 2015 12   thus ci  should also be considered for both upgrading and retreat due to their systemic criticality and worthiness of  protection  kruse et al in print   this is particularly emphasised by the new urban agenda  un 2017 p 21    adaptation strategies such as upgrading and particularly retreat imply radical changes to livelihoods  beyond  engineering questions then resilience planning needs to take into account therefore that informality not only  describes where people live but also their behaviours and practices as livelihoods can depend on informality  and informal  formal linkages  chen 2012 satterthwaite et al  2018    pelling and garschagen  2019   emphasize the importance of focussing the attention on the social vulnerability of the most vulnerable and to  measure success by supporting their needs  at worst if res ilience measures and planning ignore lived  realities of the urban poor then interventions might render marginalized communities even more vulnerable   ziervogel et al  2017    to illustrate these challenges upgrading could imply obtaining an official land title and  such spatial changes  as informal settlers are bo th highly exposed and mostly very vulnerable it needs to be  analysed how to reduce their risk exposure through either upgrading or retreat or a combination of both  thus  to minimise informal settlers ’ vulnerability and ultimately their risk through attent iveness to all aspects of  vulnerability  capacity as well as exposure   2  applicants ’ expertise profile  tu dortmund university  prof  greiving  university of stuttgart  prof

regarding the interactions  between urban development disaster risk reduction climate mitigation and climate adaptation  satterthwaite  et al  2018    these knowledge gaps exist particularly in the emerging countries in southeast asia   the  philippines is one of the countrie s most at risk to natural hazards and extreme events according to  geographical focus to the further similarly exposed neighbouring countries thailand and vietnam  therefore  it is particu larly essential in the three countries to link disaster risk reduction spatial planning and  comprehensive urban development in order to create a basis for the implementation of the sustainable  development goals  see 3 2     the new urban agenda  un 2017  commit ourselves to strengthening the  resilience of cities and human settlements including through the development of quality infrastructure and  spatial planning […] especially in risk  prone areas of formal and informal settlements […] including the  rehabilitation and upgrading of slums and informal settlements   we will also promote measures for  strengthening and retrofitting all risky housing stock  including in slums and informal settlements to make it  resilient to disasters in coordination with local authorities and stakeholders    positioning informal urban development within formal planning procedures with the complementarity of both  informal and formal institutions is a tough challenge  the urbanization process in the philippines as well as  partly i n thailand and vietnam is characterized through informality and the absence of effective formal urban  planning institutions and tools  it means that hazard  prone areas cannot be effectively kept free of settlement  development and that the existing building stock is widely physically fragile and creates a real threat for its  inhabitants in case of extreme events  consequently on  site upgrading is an important adaptation strategy  and a major research focus of lirlap  the other adaptation strategy in the focu s is retreat  the off  site  developments in the course of retreat have manifold socio  economic implications however they are often  preferred on the political agenda  for both research pillars applies that a sound evidence basis is required   see priority 1  understanding disaster risk  of the sendai framework  un isdr 2015   the february 2020  workshop successfully brought vietnam and thailand into the debates  as an active member of asean they  share the common goal of mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in the development process of asean  countries  since 2009   therefore the project  objectives gained acknowledged understanding  it is paving  a way for decision  makers to have a sound knowledge of taking appropriate actions as the call emphasises   the p roposed project focuses primarily on the areas risk management of extreme events and natural  catastrophes in rapidly growing cities and peri urban regions  but investigates also on the area integrated  urban planning   the importance of mainstreaming dis aster risk management into urban planning has  recently been underlined by the effects of the covid  19 pandemic  particularly informal settlements pose  risks for the inhabitants as well as for controlling the pandemic  nevertheless also the established  resettlement sites for the urban poor and the people living in danger zones are challenging  as of preparing  this proposal thousands of households at various resettlement sites  of national housing authority with at  least 250 000 families in luzon  may furth er slide into extreme poverty in the duration of covid  19 out of a  deficiency of sustained social protection  this is aggregated by unsolved root causes of resettlement  programmes including host  lgus ’ inability in basic service provision and integrating re settlers in the local  economic system  accordingly lirlap intends to contribute to the following discussions   addressing disaster risk via spatial planning  particularly in settlements that are most affected and least  provided with the formal system of risk reducing planning mechanisms   support mainstreaming to facilitate actual impact and translate the scientific findings into capacity building  decisive policy advice as well as into transmissive knowledge    4  description of the designed work packages and planned resear ch activities  4 1 r esults and conclusions from lirlap definition phase   as by end of june 2020    overall conclusions the definition phase has strongly confirmed the rational and necessity of the lirlap  work  the feasibility on the proposed approach has be en approved  thus there is no doubt that the intended  work plan can be successful implemented   the partnerships have been strengthened   all local partners are  highly reliable and have proven to deliver high quality output  key scientific results will be p ublished by a si  in sustainability on sustainable development of urban regions   guest editor prof  greiving     1 risk trends and resettlement options with urban growth  drivers for past urbanization as well as  possible future trends for the manila met ropolitan region were identified by evaluating past urban growth by  a satellite  based evaluation  e g  landsat   the key drivers were compromising based on a trend analysis  urbanization rates population growth and migration patterns as well as a visual cataloguing of informal  settlements  also s patial data from a study of households living directly on the city main waterways were  used  in addition a prototype of an urban growth model using sleuth was set up in the second half of the  definition phase  this exercise showed that establishing such a model is in principle possible for metro manila   an overview of relevant literature data availability and urban growth models was compiled   the state of  research has been comprehensively analysed and evaluate d to enable socio  economic scenarios  as next  step the mode lling was examined to determine whether sufficient data for indicators of certain driving forces  are available   these secondary data sets  coming from international and filipino data sets mainly from  government ngo and un sources   consisting of data on the labour market private companies and economic  sectors the level of social expenditure  share of national wealth  the average household income the  employment rate the minimum wage labour productivity property values and the availability of social  infrastructure such as schools were examined by lmu    wp2 resilient upgrading a complete inventory of key actors and their institutional constellation was  established and used for the first wor kshop in february 2020  involvement of private sectors was raised as  crucial because of their deciding role in driving metro manila ´s urban development in infrastructure investment  and resilience achievement in risk funds channelling  the stakeholder list will be continuously updated for  the second workshop and the r&d phase  based on the multi  dimensions of upgrading case selection  criteria concluded among other criteria isfs ’ views on risks their coping capacity and their social  acceptance of upgradin g as pivotal  other criteria were settlements ’ existing infrastructure and their potential  integration into the surrounding urban fabric etc  it was disclosed that in  situ upgrading versus retreat has a  low priority for the government and there is no holi stic approach regarding sustainable livelihoods and  leveraging upgrading to a city  region level  four types of in  situ upgrading were identified  1  housing  structure improvement  using durable materials adding second floor etc   2  community infrastruc ture  quite important to them    3 resilient retreat  a screening of the actors relevant to the topics of resilient retreat and resettlement  was undertaken  emphasis was also on embedding the topics in the context of urban development planning  climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction management  linked to  2    the screening was  carried out through an analysis of existing and planned upgrading and relocation projects and their ac tors  involved  in addition official legal documents such as the national housing act or the department of human  settlements and urban development act were evaluated according to official responsibilities and hierarchies   the findings led to a preliminary stakeholder matrix which represents the network of all stakeholders involved  in resilient urban development planning at the national regional local and civil society levels  it provides an  understanding of the complex governance structure of the metro manila region  existing and planned  programs and over 100 resettlement projects in metro manila and in the neighbo uring regions central luzon  and calabrazon were identified   a literature review on the measurability of resilience and the success factors  of resettlement projects was carried out  remarkably there is not any observed consideration by guidelines  or practise of selective retreat  final output will be a settlement typolog y on retreat and resettlement projects     4 capacity building and dissemination  a review and analysis of existing training courses and a  capacity needs analysis was undertaken   two course curricula on the topics of integration of community  resil iency in urban shelter planning and management and on smarter urban governance for settlements  development planning and management were developed  their evaluation by experts and a marketing  strategy are planned for the second half of 2020  the content and the legal framework of a joint phd program  was clarified by bilateral discussions with the director of postgraduate studies from surp and its counterpart  at tudo   a comparative analysis of the doctoral regulations admission criteria and doctoral courses is  completed  a draft of a joint phd agreement was coordinated with the tu dortmund legal office   it has been  positively discussed within the phd committee of the faculty of spatial planning at tudo and the director  of graduate studies at surp  a signed ag reement between tudo and surp is scheduled for the end of the  definition phase  potential partners in thailand and vietnam were identified on the basis of existing successful  cooperation and qualifications and were invited to the interim results workshop in manila in february 2020   this workshop with 50 local experts in risk disaster management from all levels aimed at creating a sound  basis for the planned workshop s in october 2020 for knowledge validation and screening of feasible  strategies as well as f or project´s outcomes dissemination    4 2 research conceptual framework and planned activities for r&d phase  as shown by figure 1 lirlap takes a dynamic perspective and assesses the impacts of future urban growth  and densification scenarios in metro manil a on first the future growth of informal settlements by means of  urban growth models considering the urban morphology and socio  economic factor and second on the  future availability of land suitable for receiving resettlement   1   moreover the r&d phase analysis  lessons learnt from other countries and deeply by fieldworks on on site upgrading of informal settlements and  on retreat options enhanced by knowledge transfer to and from thailand and vietnam  this knowledge leads  stakeholders  the same applies to tailor  made training courses and a joint phd program with up surp  where knowledge and solutions will be generated and transferred and disseminated   5    4 3 elaboration of five designed work packages of the r&d phase   1 risk trends and resettlement options with urban growth  lmu  surp  month 1  48   objectives  based on the results from the definition phase this work package aims to analyse and assess  the influences of ur ban growth and social  economic development on the risk changes of informal settlements  in metro  manila  in doing so the previously developed urban growth model using sleuth will be refined  with considerations of building types urban morphology classes an d social  economic development scenarios   shared socio ‐economic pathways   ssps   in a next step the refined urban growth model will integrate the  risk trends of informal settlements with different resettlement options in close cooperation with  2 and 3   by completing this the model will be able to simul ate and project future development of informal settlements  and the associated risk trends in several well defined urbanization and social economic scenarios  a refined  version of the model will then be transferred to the partner cities hanoi and bangkok  i t is expected that  certain adjustments of the model would be necessary in these transfers considering that the cities differ much  in physical urban environment and social economic contexts  in the second half of the project period  1  will implement bott om up qualitative scenario analysis through several workshops that involves stakeholders  of national actors city actors and local practitioners at the four case cities  meanwhile the developed bottom   up scenarios will be used to validate the modelling outputs and so to further facilitate the application of  research  modelling results into practice  beyond that the results and new methodical developments are also  prepared for training and teaching content and disseminated in a larger region for transfer   more specific and accurate information on the situation on the ground  particularly the building status in  informal settlements  the urban growth model will integrate these urban morphology data to better r eflect the  real situation of local settlements  field investigation s and data collection are planned together with wp2 and  3 to get a common understanding o f the ground context and validate remote sensing data    task 1 2 refinement of the urban growth mod el with ssp scenarios for metro  manila  lmu 8 15  month  global scenario assumptions  the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps   need to be revised for  their use in regional or local assessment s  this task will extend the global ssps to philippines and the m etro  manila areas as well as the two transfer cities  a first order draft of the scenario storylines and assumptions  will be developed in a desk study which will then be validated and refined trough a small expert validation  within the project team – as we ll as later discussed and validated against in a wider stakeholder workshop   task 1 5   using these qualitative scenario storylines and translating them into quantifications of the  parameters in the sleuth model of task 1 1 the latter will be refined so a s to being able to later model  scenarios based on the local ssp storylines  task 1 3   parameters related to informal settlements and the  availability of land suitable for resettlement will be particularly considered here    task 1 3 model risk trends usin g refined urban growth model under different resettlement or in  situ  upgrading options  lmu 16 24 month  the refined sleuth model of urban growth  task 1 1  and the  ssp type storylines  task 1 2  will then be used to model and simulate risk trends at the metro manila area  under different adaptation assumptions   based on the modelling and scenario approach this task  investigate s which influence the future urban growth in manila  spreading and densification  as well as  adaptation measures  in  situ upgrading and resettlement  will have on the growth and disaster risk of informal  settlements and newly resettled areas  hazard information will be contributed from existing data sets in the  philippines and other two partner countries  the work of this task support s the integration of the measures  developed in the other work packages with regard to the resettlement and upgrading of informal settlements   furthermore the modelling output will generate scenarios for future developments in city growth and risk  spread against which the measures from wp2 and wp3 can be evaluated for their robustness   task 1 4 transfer of the risk trend model to partner cities in thailand and vietnam  lmu 18 36 month   with the extensive modelling work done at the metro manila region th is task will transfer the modelling  approach to the comparable partner cities in southeast asia i e  hanoi and bangkok  based on the data  collection and study findings done by the local project partners in these cities  details indicated in  4   urban g rowth projection and risk trends can be simulated on a comparable basis in these cities  therefore  this task will generate comparative analysis and assessment of risk trends among the three case cities  the  result will enable a deeper understanding on ris ks of informal settlements and thus help to propose feasible  and transferable risk reduction strategies measures for decision  support    task 1 5 validate risk trends across different scenario frameworks  lmu 29

of disaster risk reduction and management as well as urban governance in the philippines  and the partner countries thailand and vietnam strengthening stakeholders’ capabilities and their networks  are crucial  therefore two training courses were designed with surp based on a training needs assessment  undertaken in a multi  stakeholder participatory approach   a  course on the integration of community resiliency in ur ban shelter planning and management  the  course aims to introduce the learners on the different aspects of community resiliency and how it can be  integrated in urban shelter planning and management  it will cover community resiliency settlements  planning and development for informal settlement families resiliency and urban governance   b  course on smarter urban governance for settlements development planning and management  the  course aims to introduce the learners on how urban governance matters in settlem ents development  planning and management  it will cover topics such as the dimensions of urban governance policy chal  lenges urban governance in relation to urban financing urban governance in the context of shelter de  velopment for informal settlement fa milies among others   in the first year of the r&d phase these two training courses will be offered to participants and further courses  developed according to the training needs and tailor  made for different target groups ranging from ministries  public and private agencies and advocates to local settlers’ groups  the first batch of courses will be evalu  ated and enhanced if needed  based on the first courses further thematic courses will be developed and  conducted in manila  the courses are planned to b e based on following modules module 1 – disaster risk  management module 2 – spatial planning module 3 – shelter planning and management and module 4 –  urban governance and new module 5   resilient retreat and new module 6   resilient upgrading  as a nex t  step the two initial training courses will be modified based on the outcomes of the preliminary offerings  from  the second year onwards the enhanced courses will be annually offered in collaboration with

implementation of the project including  identification and implementation of measures to address timing resource and management issues   tasks 6 1 project coordination  tudo + surp  this task coordinates the cooperation between the  german and international partner universities and external partners or institutes  it also manages the most  important events of the project such as the project coordination meetings practical research workshops an d  public dissemination conference s  the most important activities within this step are   establishing clear coordination structures including procedures and measures for potential conflict  resolution to be laid down in a cooperation agreement among the partner s and subcontractor s   support by subcontractors as local hub s for organizing all local activities and acting as focal point for  involving all further local stakeholders    organizing and running biannual face to face project coordination meetings including agenda setting   regular telephone or skype conferences to report on and discuss completed ongoing and planned  activities and preparation of meeting minutes   publication and regular updating of information regarding the project its results and event on th e websites  and in the respective newsletters of the partners   coordination of communication between the project and the funding organization  bmbf   dlr    coordination with the other projects supported in the program of bmbf sustainable urban regions    overall monitoring of personnel and financial resources of the project   regular reporting to bmbf   dlr regarding activities results and finances of the project   at this point in time there are no known or foreseeable problems or risks with regard to proje ct management  – not least because of the long  standing cooperation between the partners   nevertheless any problem that  might arise is discussed in the regular telephone   skype conferences and the bi annual project coord ination  meetings and agreement a n appropriate action is taken   task 6 2 project progress monitoring   lead tudo  this task evaluates the process of all work steps and  measures as well as the completion time and the quality of the results  the main measures are therefore  reviewing and tracking the cost and time con sumption of each proposed activity and outcome identification and reporting of gaps in resource and time management as well as between achieved results and the objectives of the project  documentation of the results of the above monitoring and control me chanisms  the results of the interim evaluation of the project progress are included in the minutes of the project  coordination meetings as well as in the interim and final reports  in the event of unforeseen deviations from  the planned implementation of t he project the measures identified in step 6 1 will be carried out   4 4 applied methodologies and methods  the different methods used are described in the respective activities of the above work plan  they include  desktop study including literature surv ey and development of urban growth model local fieldwork including reconnaissance survey gis  based testing of the urban growth model stakeholder workshops  focus group discussions and participatory mapping with informal settlers interviews with pol icy makers and governmental institutions and ngos and informal settler families  interactive training courses and consultation of phd students    all local research activities will be designed and implemented in local living lab s in close collaboration with  those actors which are legally responsible for the relevant tasks and play a role for their implementation  in  doing so the usability of the results can be guaranteed by co  design of the agendas and co  production of  knowledge and activities  besides international support from the regional office for asia and the pacific of  unhabitat and support agencies from the phi lippines  annex 9 3  e g  national housing agencies  department of public works and highways and lgus for the potential upgrading case settlements are  actively involved  this underline s that the project is aware of the existing initiatives in the field of disaster risk  management  the same will apply to local institutions and initiatives in the partner countries thailand and  vietnam  close interaction among all partners is further guaranteed due to the collaborative character of the  workshops all partners including partner countries thailand and vietnam take part in all workshops and bring  in their specific perspectives from the tasks they are mainly responsible for  moreover all deliverables will  pass an internal review process for which those partners r esearchers are responsible that were previously  not directly involved as authors  by doing so the consistency of the overall wo rk flow and the relevant results  can be guaranteed   5 2 partners from thailand and vietnam for the r&d phase  for the worksho p in february 2020 lirlap had invited potential partners for the r&d phase form vietnam  and thailand who were working in the fields of lirlap  in course of the workshop p articipants from thailand  urban futures & policy research unit  ufp  of thammasat uni versity and faculty of land management of  the vietnam national university of agriculture confirmed their interest in being partner s for the r&d phase  and have proved to be qualified partner s  see annex 9 3   the partners will serve as focal point for furth er  research and application of research in their countries with planned local training workshops   5 3 envisaged collaboration structure and project management  the tu dortmund university university of stuttgart and lmu munich will collaboratively perform the work  program  monthly skype or telephone meetings are scheduled for a smooth working process  the research  office of surp planades will act as subcontractor of tu dortmund university and focal point of all local  activities while the partners from thailand and vietnam are subcontracted by the two other german  universities   planades will receive funding for staff costs travel events and equipment  it contributes with  in kind contributions of about 50000 €   10000 € in case of the two other subcontractors  for the  involvement of permanent staff in research and phd training activities and events bringing in equipment for  events   the subcontractors are responsible for the following activities   annex 9  2 cooperation agreement s  and offer of services    jointly designing the project and research strategies and methods  all subcontractors     co organizing events and participating international conferences and publications  all subcontractors     conducting l ocal socio  economic profiling supervising local fieldwork managing data and organising  travel activities of the aforementioned further local partners  all subcontractors    and resilience urban governance and disaster  planades only     5 4 strategy for pooling and integr ating various bodies of knowledge  the pooling of different bodies of knowledge and data is achieved through sharing all project data on a project  file server  hosted by tu dortmund university  to which all project partners have access  data generated in  the project will further be made available for all project partners and publicly after key publications have been  achieved  all local data will be provided by surp  surp has access to all relevant statistical data and  manages its own gis data base  access i s guaranteed   annex 9 2 offer of services   the integration of  different knowledge types is a core component of lirlap   all of the assessment steps outlined in the work  plan eventually depend on the integration of different knowledge types  the urban growt h model for example  will integrate statistical data from past time lines with expert judgement from key partners in the project  the  same holds true for the products in the other work packages  the assessments are therefore truly inter   and  transdiscipli nary  in addition frequent meetings via skype and on site meetings ensure a close cooperation  and personal communication between the different partners   5 5 strategy for handling potential conflicts  the project partners have been able to build substantial trust amongst each other throughout many previous  joint projects  conflicts are therefore not expected  nevertheless all project partners will develop and sign a  cooperation agreement before the start of the project  this agreement will set out the rules and regulations  to avoid and govern potential conflicts e g  with respect to co  publications   6  expected results their potential applications and follow  ups  scientific and commercial   key products of  2 and 3 are going to be implemented in the subsequ ent implementation phase  1  the wp2 pilot study with resilient upgrading design guidelines shall be politically approved by its affiliated  lgu which is legally responsible to implement urban housing and development programmes at the end  of the r&d phase  it is to be replicated in other upgrading sites of high  risk informal settlements in metro  manila for city  region wide upscaling  concrete physical upgrading measures will be tested within the  implementation phase and promise als o commercial follow  ups for kaiseringenieure   2   3 concludes with a retreat guideline  here knowledge gap such as strategy of selective retreat is  expected to be addressed via joint activities of wp2 and wp3  furthermore these guidelines will be  applied by a pilot study to be poli tically approved by the responsible lgu at the end of the r&d phase   this study will be integrated in real  life planning processes within the implementation phase    apart from the potential implementation phase all wps results of r&d phase are transferrabl e to partner  countries and countries with similar development contexts characterised with rampant urbanisation co   existence of informality ineffective planning and high risk and hazard potentials  the r&d phase will seek in   1 for the development of ur ban growth models with ssp scenarios under different resettlement or in  situ  upgrading options for metro manila and transfer the risk trend model to partner cities in thailand and vietnam  as well as validate the risk trends under different scenario assumpt ions  as final step a cross  country analysis institutions at national and city regional horizontals  lirlap highlights the need for research on disaster risk  governance binding not only tho se cross governmental agenci es in the individual lirlap partner countries  but al so to be among asean states  both lirlap partner countries are activ e members of asean  committee on disaster management  as a platform for cross country academi a communications the project  synergiz es the understanding on critical regional challeng es and solution seekin g  this platform vi a lirlap  unlocks potentials of utilizing the existing regional mechanism in handling disaster management   5  focus es on capacity building on the topi cs of lirlap by training courses an d a phd program  th e training  program s are designed on a cost recovery scheme and can be executed after lirla p  the same applies to  the phd program since scholarshi ps for candidate s are not part of lirlap an d thus the program can continue  independently  8  proposed working steps and budg et plan
